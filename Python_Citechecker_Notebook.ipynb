      "The Elected Servant:   Limiting Judicial Overview of Prosecutor’s Nolle: Prosequi Power to Corruption and Infringement on Defendant’s Rights\n",
      "Matthew Patalano\n",
      "“The primary duty of the prosecutor is to seek justice within the bounds of the law, not merely to convict.   The prosecutor serves the public interest and should act with integrity and balanced judgment to increase public safety both by pursuing appropriate criminal charges of appropriate severity, and by exercising discretion to not pursue criminal charges in appropriate circumstances.   ”\n",
      "I.  Introduction\n",
      "\tOver the last few years, people have elected many progressive district attorneys on a platform of ending mass incarceration.  One of the primary tools these progressive: district attorneys have utilized to further this goal is the nolle prosequi.  The nolle prosequi is “an entry on a record in a criminal case file that the prosecutor or court has discontinued the case.”  When given complete discretion to nolle prosequi, the prosecutor has total control over when charges are dismissed prior to trial and even post-conviction .  \n",
      "\tDespite its influential nature, there is not one unifying theory on the amount of discretion prosecutors should have when it comes to the use of the nolle prosequi.  Many state judicial branches view the power of the nolle prosequi as quintessential to a prosecutor’s authority.  Others consider judicial oversight to be necessary to prevent evil and corrupt prosecutors from using the nolle prosequi inappropriately.  Seven states have decided that the nolle prosequi is too dangerous and have abolished it all together.  Seventeen states have required prosecutors to obtain the court’s consent, otherwise known as leave of court, prior to exercising their discretion not to prosecute.  Still others have limited the power of prosecutors only in situations where bad faith is clearly shown.  \n",
      "This Note will examine the history of the nolle prosequi as a tool of prosecutorial discretion and how it implicates the power of both state and federal executive branches, judicial branches, and the grand jury.  It begins by outlining a national census as to different states approaches to judicial oversight of the nolle prosequi.  This Note then discuses the limits and benefits of each of these approaches and argues that judicial oversight of prosecutorial discretion not to prosecute should be limited to circumstances of prosecutorial corruption and infringement of defendant’s rights.  Finally, this Note concludes by recommending limited judicial oversight while requiring prosecutors state their reasoning on the record to balance both the autonomy of prosecutors as elected officials and the sanctity of defendants’ rights.  \n",
      "II.  History\n",
      "A.  Prosecutor as Servants of the Law \n",
      "\tBoth state and federal prosecutors are government officials within the executive branch responsible for reviewing evidence and assisting criminal investigations.  A prosecutor is also responsible for determining whom to prosecute based on the sufficiency of the evidence.  Finally, prosecutors are responsible for overseeing prosecutions according to applicable constitutions, statutes, and precedent.  The Supreme Court  has described prosecutors as “the servant[s] of the law” tasked to both punish the guilty and ensure that the innocent do not suffer.  Federally, the executive branch has a constitutional duty to make sure that laws passed by the legislative branch are faithfully executed.  \n",
      "In response to the requirements of the Constitution, Congress created the Office of the Attorney General by enacting the Judiciary Act of 1789.  At the time, the attorney general was only responsible for representing the United States in court and advising the president and agency heads on questions of law.  The attorney general’s original obligations were limited to cases argued in front of the Supreme Court.  Federal district attorneys, known today as U.S. attorneys, were initially responsible for the representation of the United States in local district and circuit courts.  The Attorney General, under the Judiciary act of 1789, had no authority over these federal district attorneys.  In 1861, however, the attorney general was given statutory power over these federal district attorneys and could control how they went about their prosecutions.  In 1870, the Department of Justice was created to assist the attorney general in their duties and solidified the attorney general as the head.  \n",
      "\tState constitutions, modeled after the U.S. Constitution, grant state executive branches the responsibility to make sure that “the laws be faithfully executed.”  This duty is carried out by state attorney generals and local prosecutors.  Most states vest the attorney general with exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction over a specific number of limited issues, such as cases involving public corruption, fraud, regulatory crimes, or when local prosecutors have conflicts of interests.  The vast majority of states hold elections for local prosecutors who oversee prosecutions within a geographic-based jurisdiction that fall outside the state attorney general’s responsibility.  \n",
      "B.  The Importance and Scope of Prosecutorial Discretion\n",
      "\tBecause prosecutors are solely responsible for determining which criminal cases to charge and how to proceed with the litigation, the prosecutor’s personal judgement, otherwise known as prosecutorial discretion, can change the direction of a case.  Prosecutors’ status as elected officials allowed local prosecutors to exercise more of their own, individual discretion in enforcing the laws because they were no longer subject to the varying opinions and politics of those who appointed them.  By 1912, forty-eight states had local prosecutors, all but five of which were elected.  There was an increase in crime shortly after World War I, which shined a spotlight on prosecutors and led to a national reexamination of the state prosecutor’s role.  Both local and federal crime commissions were created across the country to lead this examination and found that the elective nature of local prosecutors led to undue influence from inappropriate sources.  \n",
      "From the first allegations of criminal conduct to the end of a criminal case, prosecutors have several key moments when they may use their discretion to alter the course of a case.  Currently, there is no universal requirement for prosecutors to publicly state how they use this discretion.  Although prosecutors are not required to publicly report on how they use their discretion, several independent groups have begun to collect data on the prosecutorial exercise of discretion to allow voters to make educated decisions.  Additionally, advocates are fighting for laws which would increase prosecutorial transparency and would require prosecutors to report data on defendants throughout all stages of litigation.  \n",
      "First, during an investigation, a prosecutor can exercise discretion by guiding police toward certain lines of investigation and by deciding whether to use subpoenas and warrants to obtain new evidence.  Much of the modern prosecutor’s time is spent exercising discretion during the investigation of criminal charges and making important investigative decisions.  The Supreme Court has recognized that the prosecutor’s role as an advocate for the state extends to investigative actions outside the courtroom setting.  Other than ethical concerns and constitutional limitations, decision making at this phase is without judicial oversight both to give the prosecutor a necessary amount of autonomy and because oversight at this phase would be practically infeasible.  \n",
      "Second, before charges are filed, prosecutors use their discretion to decide what charges to bring based on the evidence, the prosecutor’s doubts, and the public interest.  After the investigation, the decision whether or not to prosecute and the decision of what charges to file or bring before a grand jury generally rests entirely in the prosecutor’s discretion.  The prosecutor must weigh the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence policies, enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to any overall enforcement plan.  Because the factors the prosecutor weighs in each case are ill-suited for judicial oversight, discretion at this phase is naturally very broad.  \n",
      "Third, during plea bargaining prosecutor’s use their discretion to decide what offers to make to defendants and which of the defendants offers to accept.  There is no constitutional right to plea bargain, and the prosecutor does not need to participate in any negotiation if the prosecutor prefers to go to trial.  Nevertheless, state prosecutors rely on discretion during plea bargaining and nearly 90% of all criminal cases in the United States end in plea agreements.  Prosecutors have been allowed broad discretion in this stage of litigation because judges are free to accept or not accept guilty pleas and have full control of sentencing.  \n",
      "Fourth, during grand jury proceedings and during and before trial, the prosecutor may choose how best to present evidence of guilt and decide which proper arguments to put forward.  Prosecutors have wide latitude to present evidence and make any proper legal arguments in whatever manner they feel is best.  \n",
      "Finally, after charges have been filed, prosecutors may use their discretion to decide to discontinue or abandon a pending case.  During litigation, prosecutors have the ability to discontinue or abandon a case through either filing a motion to dismiss the case or a nolle prosequi.  Federal prosecutors have wide latitude concerning when to formally dismiss charges, although leave of court is still necessary.  Some federal circuits have held that judges may withhold leave of court only if the prosecutor’s request is clearly contrary to manifest public interest.  State courts also require judicial approval for any dismissal and have similar standards for when a judge may withhold consent.  \n",
      "C.  The Nolle Prosequi as a Tool of Discretion\n",
      "Prosecutors can similarly enter a nolle prosequi, either with or without the consent of court depending on the jurisdiction, to end a criminal case in favor of the accused.  The prosecution may reopen a case in which they have entered a nolle prosequi with a new indictment if the new charges are within the statute of limitations period.  Both federally and on the state level, the prosecution may enter a nolle prosequi any time before jeopardy attaches, which occurs when the jury is empaneled or, in a nonjury trial, when the court has begun hearing evidence.  Although a nolle prosequi is similar to a motion to dismiss, the requirements for charges to be abandoned via a nolle prosequi vary greatly in each jurisdiction and can have serious implications on prosecutorial autonomy.  Although many courts and statutes use the terms nolle prosequi and motion for dismissal interchangeably, the difference is that prosecutors discretion varies across jurisdictions when filing a nolle prosequi, but must always seek the court’s consent when filing a motion to dismiss.  \n",
      "1.  Colonial Era Adoption of Nolle Prosequi\n",
      "Around the Sixteenth Century, the nolle prosequi began in England as a procedural device that the royally-appointed attorney general could use to terminate an ongoing criminal prosecution.  During this period, the public prosecuted most offenses and accordingly many prosecutions were frivolous.  The attorney general in England used the nolle prosequi to dismiss prosecutions that they regarded as frivolous or in contravention of royal interests.  This power was entirely within the domain of the attorney general and thus no form of judicial review existed.  \n",
      "The American-colonial system differed from the English system because American colonies had many more prosecutors than England.  The American colonies established a system for processing official prosecutions that was extremely complex and required more prosecutors to handle the increased workload.  Due to the increased number of prosecutors, colonial governors, through their general law enforcement powers, had to direct these prosecutors and often did so by requiring them to enter a nolle prosequi on cases the governors thought did not merit prosecution.  Prosecutors also used the nolle prosequi to control criminal prosecutions they had begun if they later gathered information that indicated pursuing the prosecution was no longer just or proper.  \n",
      "2.  Historic Use of Nolle Prosequi in Federal Prosecution\n",
      "Debate over the amount of power the federal executive branch should have to use the nolle prosequi began shortly after the United States was founded.  The first national debate regarding the nolle prosequi stemmed from public response to presidential decisions made after an individual was arrested in February 1799 in South Carolina and accused of participating in a mutiny on a British ship.  This case caused a national outcry because citizens were concerned over the uneven use of the nolle prosequi and the amount of discretion at the executive branch’s disposal and discussion in Congress quickly followed regarding the discretion to nolle prosequi.  \n",
      "Republicans denounced the monarchial tendencies of extreme executive power posed by complete discretion to begin and end prosecutions.  Congressman John Marshall argued the executive branch had the power to enter a nolle prosequi and that the court was powerless to review or deny its entry.  In 1944, Congress definitively ended the debate regarding the federal nolle prosequi by codifying judicial oversight of the federal nolle prosequi under Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  \n",
      "3.  Modern Use of the Nolle Prosequi Generally\n",
      "\n",
      "The power to nolle prosequi implicates the power of state executive and judicial branches as well as state grand juries.  State courts have a duty to protect defendants’ rights and provide orderly administration of criminal justice, which gives them the power to supervise all trials and court proceedings.  Although the responsibilities and obligations of state grand juries vary, they often are tasked with assessing the propriety of criminal charges.  See Susan W. Brenner, Faults, Fallacies, and the Future of Our Criminal Justice System:  The Voice of the Community:  A Case for Grand Jury Independence, 3 Va. J. Soc. Pol'y & l. 67, 97 (1995) (stating variety of approaches states take regarding grand juries’ role).  \n",
      "Entry of a nolle prosequi is only allowed at certain times during the course of litigation.  Prosecutors cannot unilaterally enter a nolle prosequi once the trial has begun or a jury is impaneled as an additional safeguard to defendant’s rights.  Some states also require court’s consent after an indictment is returned in an effort to protect the power and independence of the grand jury.  Finally, a prosecutor’s authority to nolle prosequi often returns once the trial has concluded with a guilty verdict because nolle prosequi at this stage no longer infringes upon defendant’s rights to due process.  \n",
      "D.  State Approaches to Judicial Oversight of Nolle Prosequi\n",
      "\tDespite the common origins of the nolle prosequi, states are disparate in the discretion they grant prosecutors to enter a nolle prosequi without judicial oversight.  Notwithstanding subtle nuances in every state, states fall within three major categories in the amount of autonomy given to prosecutors in their entry of a nolle prosequi.  The first category of states have given their prosecutors wide authority and autonomy to nolle prosequi with extremely limited oversight.  The next category of states have given judges the ability to curtail the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi power, albeit with varying conditions required.  The final category of states have limited or abolished the nolle prosequi and require a prosecutor to file a motion to dismiss in any situation where they would like to discontinue or abandon the case.  \n",
      "1.  Broad Prosecutorial Authority to Nolle Prosequi\n",
      "Many states’ constitution directly or indirectly grant prosecutors the discretion to nolle prosequi.  Alaska, Florida, Rhode Island, Nebraska, and Nevada courts have all interpreted that prosecutorial discretion is not subject to judicial review because the power is constitutionallybased.  In these states, the courts have no ability to decline the entry of a nolle prosequi unless the nolle prosequi impedes on the defendant’s rights or is inherently unconstitutional.  \n",
      "\tOther jurisdictions have continued to give broad discretion to prosecutors even when their constitutions do not directly grant prosecutors total autonomy.  DC, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, and South Dakota all currently allow prosecutors to enter nolle prosequis with no, or very little judicial, oversight.  These states vary as to whether they require a prosecutor to state their reasons on the record for the nolle prosequi.  Even though prosecutors are given complete discretion in these states, judicial review is still allowed and expected in certain specific situations that vary in each state but often include corruption, capricious or scandalous behavior, and infringement on defendants rights.  For example, in State v. Reimonenq, court acknowledged that the prosecutor had sole discretion to make decisions regarding prosecution, but stated that the prosecutorial decision to nolle prosequi the case and refile simply to organize their case upset the balance between the prosecutor’s discretion and the accused rights to such a degree that it violated the defendants right to due process and fundamental fairness.  \n",
      "2.  Discretion to Nolle Prosequi with Leave of Court\n",
      "Still other jurisdictions, including Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, North Dakota, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia require prosecutors to obtain leave of court.  The requirement to obtain leave of court is a statutory requirement in a majority of these states.  Although these states all allow courts to withhold consent,  vary widely regarding when a court may withhold consent.  Michigan, North Dakota, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia require only that the prosecutor has sound reasons for deciding to file a nolle prosequi and for the prosecutor to state those reasons to the court.  Other states, such as Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania have allowed courts to have much wider discretion to withhold consent as they see fit.  Alabama, Colorado, Mississippi, and Texas fall between those two extremes by allowing judges to withhold consent only if they have reasonable justification.  \n",
      "Some jurisdictions, including Iowa, Missouri, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming , but only if the prosecutor has met certain threshold requirements.  Iowa and Missouri simply require that the prosecutor present their reasoning for entering a nolle prosequi.  Similarly, Virginia requires that the prosecutor have good cause for exercising their discretion.  Lastly, Wisconsin and Wyoming require the court to consider the public interest and will limit prosecutorial discretion if made in bad faith.  \n",
      "3.  Limited Application or Abolishment\n",
      "The final category of states are those that have completely abolished the nolle prosequi or limited its usage to extremely specific situations.  California, Idaho, Maine, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Washington have abolished the nolle prosequi entirely.  These states require a prosecutor to file a motion to dismiss.  \n",
      "Arizona and Connecticut outline exactly when a prosecutor is authorized to file a nolle prosequi.  In Connecticut, the filing of nolle prosequi without defendant’s consent is limited by state statute unless a material witness has died, disappeared, or become disabled or where material evidence has disappeared or been destroyed.  Alternatively, Arizona only allows prosecutors to offer a nolle prosequi in consideration of the accused becoming a witness for the state.  \n",
      "E.  Impact of Judicial Oversight (or ack hereof) on Criminal Justice\n",
      "Modern experts are currently debating whether the nolle prosequi is a tool that should be used to lower the extremely high rate of incarceration in America.  \n",
      "In Massachusetts, the courts recently had to decide the amount of autonomy prosecutors are allowed when attempting to use the nolle prosequi to address mass incarceration.  During a “Straight Pride Parade” in Boston, several protestors were arrested and the local District Attorney, Rachel Rollins, sought to have the non-violent offender’s cases dismissed through a nolle prosequi.  The trial judge denied the Commonwealth’s nolle prosequi on the charge of disorderly conduct.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court found that the trial judge had no authority to deny the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi.   The court contemplated that curtailment of the power to nolle prosequi may be allowed in “instances of scandalous abuse of authority,” of which this was not one.  \n",
      "III.  Analysis\n",
      "Every variation of state approaches to judicial power over the prosecutor’s discretion to enter a nolle prosequi comes with unique shortcomings and benefits.  No approach is perfect and experts can disagree about how to properly balance the nolle prosequi’s power to respect the exclusive domain of the xecutive ranch, the udicial ranch, and the rand ury.  Analyzing the pros and cons of each approach, however, reveals an optimal balance between the executive branches discretion and judicial branches concern for defendants’ constitutional .  \n",
      "A.  Limiting Judicial Oversight Allows Prosecutors to Act as Elected Servants\n",
      "States that have given their prosecutors autonomy to nolle prosequi with limited judicial oversight correctly allow their prosecutors to act as elected representatives.  One problem to this approach is that it may make trial judges unwilling to investigate the reasons behind a nolle prosequi.  This could potentially lead to undiscovered corruption or accidental infringement on defendants rights.   courts utilizing this approach tend to be unwilling to discuss or define corrupt or scandalous behavior, which may leave trial judges unable to recognize abuses of authority when they see it.  A final problem to this approach for states that do not require the prosecutor to state their reasoning on the record is that voters will be unable to make informed decisions based on the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi usage.  \n",
      "States that have given judges the ability to curtail the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi power incorrectly limit the xecutive ranch’s ability to ensure that he laws be faithfully executed.  Giving prosecutors discretion allows voters to remedy prosecution policy viewed as either too harsh or too lenient by voting based on said policy.  Allowing judges to curtail that discretion simply hinders the ability of the voters to correct problematic prosecutorial decision making on a larger scale.  One benefit to this approach, however, is that individual defendants are much more protected and less likely to be caught up in the passing whim of the voters.  \n",
      "States that have abolished or limited the nolle prosequi have inappropriately removed a tool prosecutors have relied on since before the founding of America.  In practice, states that have abolished the nolle prosequi behave similarly to states that require leave of court because a motion to dismiss also requires the court’s approval.  States that have limited the nolle prosequi to specific situations also behave similarly to states that require leave of court because a motion to dismiss is required for in any unspecified circumstances.  Both of these categories accordingly have the same benefits and shortcomings as states that have given judges the ability to curtail the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi power.  \n",
      "B.  The Ideal Balance of Power Between Judges and Prosecutors\n",
      "All states recognize that there are certain situations where the entry of a nolle prosequi is inappropriate, and an ideal balance would also recognize these limitations.  Judges must be able to intervene if the prosecutor’s  nolle prosequi is deemed unconstitutional.  This also means that judges must be impowered to protect defendants rights.  To ensure that no individual defendant not injured or improperly benefit from inappropriate exercise prosecutorial discretion, judges must be able to intervene if there is undisputed evidence of corruption.  Judges should not, however, be impowered to intervene in instances of “scandalous behavior,” as any ability to do so might invite inappropriate judicial encroachment into the power of the xecutive ranch.  \n",
      "As elected representatives, however, the prosecutors should have full autonomy outside of these limited exceptions to decide when to nolle prosequi.  Allowing prosecutors discretion is consistent with the historical use of the nolle prosequi.  Broad discretion to nolle prosequi would also be consistent with the amount of prosecutorial discretion allowed during other stages of litigation.  Many states already give prosecutors this appropriate amount of discretion.  \n",
      "The main drawback to allowing prosecutors discretion is the risk of undetected corruption or unconstitutional motives.  This can easily be avoided if prosecutors are made publicly accountable by being statutorily required to state their reasons on the record.  Requiring prosecutors to state their reasons empowers citizens to vote based on prosecutorial decisions to nolle prosequi.  This requirement in no way hinders the prosecution if their motives are constitutional and uncorrupt.  \n",
      "C.  The Importance of Democratic Accountability\n",
      " democracy is dependent on elected representatives’ ability to perform the central duties of their office with discretion.  Although  largely behind the scenes, prosecutors have been able to use their discretion at various stages of litigation to ensure that laws faithfully executed, not just robotically so.  Handicapping the xecutive ranchs discretion and allowing the udicial ranch to interfere with the entry of any nolle prosequi outside of constitutional justifications or instances of corruption is a violation of separation of powers and threatens the quintessential balance of power our criminal justice system depends on.  Taking discretion away from locallyelected prosecutors also harms every voter who might wish to see the nolle prosequi used more or less often.  \n",
      "Imposing arbitrary judicial limits on prosecutorial discretion to enter a nolle prosequi not only harms the system at large, but individual defendants as well.  Our country currently faces a mass incarceration crisis which many prosecutors are attempting to fix.  Taking discretion away from prosecutors will cause many defendants to be charged even if the general populace is against such an action.  \n",
      "IV.  Conclusion\n",
      "Local prosecutors are the correct wielders of the discretion to nolle prosequi as elected servants.  The decision whether or not to prosecute should be made by prosecutors as part of their duty to faithfully execute the laws.  Local prosecutors elected status makes them accountable to the public for their decisions, including their decisions to nolle prosequi.  If the discretion to nolle prosequi is taken away from prosecutors, the power simply transfers to judges.  This leads to a fundamental upheaval of separation of powers in an unacceptable manner.  \n",
      "To ensure that prosecutors remain accountable for their actions, certain fundamental safeguards must be put in place.  Voters should have the ability to review every reason for every nolle prosequi to make educated decisions when inside the ballot box.  Additionally, judges should be able to review the reasons for a nolle prosequi to ensure that the prosecutor hasn’t acted corruptly and to protect the defendant’s constitutional rights.  In sum, although every state is free to balance the separations of powers as they see fit, local prosecutors should be given discretion to nolle prosequi within constitutional limits while being statutorily required to explain their reasoning on the record.  This approach is the correct way to balance the Executive and Judicial powers and protects both defendants’ and voters’ rights and interests.  \n"

Pol. & Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 343, 343 (2010) (connecting relationship between high incarceration and prosecutorial discretion).  In 2019, the total prison population in the United States was 1,430,800, which is often described by experts as a mass incarceration crisis.  See U.S. Dep’t of Just., Prisoners in 2019, 1 (2020), https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p19.pdf, [https://perma.cc/NB66-5DLG] (comparing prison population trends over several years); Traum, supra note 2, at 425 (defining mass incarceration and arguing harmful and destabilizing effects on communities); Mirko Bagaric et al., Mitigating America’s Mass Incarceration Crisis Without Compromising Community Protection:  Expanding the Role of Rehabilitation in Sentencing, 22 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 3, 59 (2018) (concluding the United States experiencing unprecedented mass incarceration crisis).  In the past ten years, prosecutors have examined the operation of the criminal justice and pushed for alternatives to incarceration.  See Yaroshefsky, supra at 343-45 (noting state initiatives with reform focus).  These alternatives include community service, electronic monitoring, probation, restitution, or treatment.  See generally James Austin, A Guidelines Proposal:  How Many Americans are Unnecessarily Incarcerated?, 29 Fed. Sent. R. 140 (2017) (considering proposed alternatives to incarceration and arguing their superior effectiveness).  Many experts assert that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi, should be used to end the mass incarceration crisis in the United States.  See Jeffrey Bellin, Reassessing Prosecutorial Power Through the Lens of Mass Incarceration, 116 Mich. L. Rev. 835, 836 (2018) (articulating legal expert’s opinion that prosecutors can alleviate damage caused by mass incarceration); Angela J. Davis, The Prosecutor’s Ethical Duty to End Mass Incarceration, 44 Hofstra L. Rev. 1063, 1085 (2016) (concluding prosecutors have ethical duty to end mass incarceration).  Other experts feel that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi has played a significant role in causing the mass incarceration crisis.  See Bellin, supra at 836 (highlighting role many experts believe prosecutors played in causing mass incarceration crisis); Davis, supra at 1085 (blaming prosecutors for mass incarceration crisis).  \n",

      "\tOver the last few years, people have elected many progressive district attorneys on a platform of ending mass incarceration.  One of the primary tools these progressive: district attorneys have utilized to further this goal is the nolle prosequi.  The nolle prosequi is “an entry on a record in a criminal case file that the prosecutor or court has discontinued the case.”  When given complete discretion to nolle prosequi, the prosecutor has total control over when charges are dismissed prior to trial and even post-conviction .  \n",

      "\n",
      "\tDespite its influential nature, there is not one unifying theory on the amount of discretion prosecutors should have when it comes to the use of the nolle prosequi.  Many state judicial branches view the power of the nolle prosequi as quintessential to a prosecutor’s authority.  Others consider judicial oversight to be necessary to prevent evil and corrupt prosecutors from using the nolle prosequi inappropriately.  Seven states have decided that the nolle prosequi is too dangerous and have abolished it all together.  Seventeen states have required prosecutors to obtain the court’s consent, otherwise known as leave of court, prior to exercising their discretion not to prosecute.  Still others have limited the power of prosecutors only in situations where bad faith is clearly shown.  \n",

      "This Note will examine the history of the nolle prosequi as a tool of prosecutorial discretion and how it implicates the power of both state and federal executive branches, judicial branches, and the grand jury.  It begins by outlining a national census as to different states approaches to judicial oversight of the nolle prosequi.  This Note then discuses the limits and benefits of each of these approaches and argues that judicial oversight of prosecutorial discretion not to prosecute should be limited to circumstances of prosecutorial corruption and infringement of defendant’s rights.  Finally, this Note concludes by recommending limited judicial oversight while requiring prosecutors state their reasoning on the record to balance both the autonomy of prosecutors as elected officials and the sanctity of defendants’ rights.  \n",

      "\n",
      "\tBoth state and federal prosecutors are government officials within the executive branch responsible for reviewing evidence and assisting criminal investigations.  A prosecutor is also responsible for determining whom to prosecute based on the sufficiency of the evidence.  Finally, prosecutors are responsible for overseeing prosecutions according to applicable constitutions, statutes, and precedent.  The Supreme Court  has described prosecutors as “the servant[s] of the law” tasked to both punish the guilty and ensure that the innocent do not suffer.  Federally, the executive branch has a constitutional duty to make sure that laws passed by the legislative branch are faithfully executed.  \n",

      "In response to the requirements of the Constitution, Congress created the Office of the Attorney General by enacting the Judiciary Act of 1789.  At the time, the attorney general was only responsible for representing the United States in court and advising the president and agency heads on questions of law.  The attorney general’s original obligations were limited to cases argued in front of the Supreme Court.  Federal district attorneys, known today as U.S. attorneys, were initially responsible for the representation of the United States in local district and circuit courts.  The Attorney General, under the Judiciary act of 1789, had no authority over these federal district attorneys.  In 1861, however, the attorney general was given statutory power over these federal district attorneys and could control how they went about their prosecutions.  In 1870, the Department of Justice was created to assist the attorney general in their duties and solidified the attorney general as the head.  \n",

      "\n",
      "\tState constitutions, modeled after the U.S. Constitution, grant state executive branches the responsibility to make sure that “the laws be faithfully executed.”  This duty is carried out by state attorney generals and local prosecutors.  Most states vest the attorney general with exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction over a specific number of limited issues, such as cases involving public corruption, fraud, regulatory crimes, or when local prosecutors have conflicts of interests.  The vast majority of states hold elections for local prosecutors who oversee prosecutions within a geographic-based jurisdiction that fall outside the state attorney general’s responsibility.  \n",

      "\n",
      "\tBecause prosecutors are solely responsible for determining which criminal cases to charge and how to proceed with the litigation, the prosecutor’s personal judgement, otherwise known as prosecutorial discretion, can change the direction of a case.  Prosecutors’ status as elected officials allowed local prosecutors to exercise more of their own, individual discretion in enforcing the laws because they were no longer subject to the varying opinions and politics of those who appointed them.  By 1912, forty-eight states had local prosecutors, all but five of which were elected.  There was an increase in crime shortly after World War I, which shined a spotlight on prosecutors and led to a national reexamination of the state prosecutor’s role.  Both local and federal crime commissions were created across the country to lead this examination and found that the elective nature of local prosecutors led to undue influence from inappropriate sources.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 15 \n",
      "\n",
      "From the first allegations of criminal conduct to the end of a criminal case, prosecutors have several key moments when they may use their discretion to alter the course of a case.  Currently, there is no universal requirement for prosecutors to publicly state how they use this discretion.  Although prosecutors are not required to publicly report on how they use their discretion, several independent groups have begun to collect data on the prosecutorial exercise of discretion to allow voters to make educated decisions.  Additionally, advocates are fighting for laws which would increase prosecutorial transparency and would require prosecutors to report data on defendants throughout all stages of litigation.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 16 \n",
      "\n",
      "First, during an investigation, a prosecutor can exercise discretion by guiding police toward certain lines of investigation and by deciding whether to use subpoenas and warrants to obtain new evidence.  Much of the modern prosecutor’s time is spent exercising discretion during the investigation of criminal charges and making important investigative decisions.  The Supreme Court has recognized that the prosecutor’s role as an advocate for the state extends to investigative actions outside the courtroom setting.  Other than ethical concerns and constitutional limitations, decision making at this phase is without judicial oversight both to give the prosecutor a necessary amount of autonomy and because oversight at this phase would be practically infeasible.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 17 \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, before charges are filed, prosecutors use their discretion to decide what charges to bring based on the evidence, the prosecutor’s doubts, and the public interest.  After the investigation, the decision whether or not to prosecute and the decision of what charges to file or bring before a grand jury generally rests entirely in the prosecutor’s discretion.  The prosecutor must weigh the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence policies, enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to any overall enforcement plan.  Because the factors the prosecutor weighs in each case are ill-suited for judicial oversight, discretion at this phase is naturally very broad.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 18 \n",
      "\n",
      "Third, during plea bargaining prosecutor’s use their discretion to decide what offers to make to defendants and which of the defendants offers to accept.  There is no constitutional right to plea bargain, and the prosecutor does not need to participate in any negotiation if the prosecutor prefers to go to trial.  Nevertheless, state prosecutors rely on discretion during plea bargaining and nearly 90% of all criminal cases in the United States end in plea agreements.  Prosecutors have been allowed broad discretion in this stage of litigation because judges are free to accept or not accept guilty pleas and have full control of sentencing.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 20 \n",

      "Finally, after charges have been filed, prosecutors may use their discretion to decide to discontinue or abandon a pending case.  During litigation, prosecutors have the ability to discontinue or abandon a case through either filing a motion to dismiss the case or a nolle prosequi.  Federal prosecutors have wide latitude concerning when to formally dismiss charges, although leave of court is still necessary.  Some federal circuits have held that judges may withhold leave of court only if the prosecutor’s request is clearly contrary to manifest public interest.  State courts also require judicial approval for any dismissal and have similar standards for when a judge may withhold consent.  \n",

      "Prosecutors can similarly enter a nolle prosequi, either with or without the consent of court depending on the jurisdiction, to end a criminal case in favor of the accused.  The prosecution may reopen a case in which they have entered a nolle prosequi with a new indictment if the new charges are within the statute of limitations period.  Both federally and on the state level, the prosecution may enter a nolle prosequi any time before jeopardy attaches, which occurs when the jury is empaneled or, in a nonjury trial, when the court has begun hearing evidence.  Although a nolle prosequi is similar to a motion to dismiss, the requirements for charges to be abandoned via a nolle prosequi vary greatly in each jurisdiction and can have serious implications on prosecutorial autonomy.  Although many courts and statutes use the terms nolle prosequi and motion for dismissal interchangeably, the difference is that prosecutors discretion varies across jurisdictions when filing a nolle prosequi, but must always seek the court’s consent when filing a motion to dismiss.  \n",

      "Around the Sixteenth Century, the nolle prosequi began in England as a procedural device that the royally-appointed attorney general could use to terminate an ongoing criminal prosecution.  During this period, the public prosecuted most offenses and accordingly many prosecutions were frivolous.  The attorney general in England used the nolle prosequi to dismiss prosecutions that they regarded as frivolous or in contravention of royal interests.  This power was entirely within the domain of the attorney general and thus no form of judicial review existed.  \n",

The American colonies established a system for processing official prosecutions that was extremely complex and required more prosecutors to handle the increased workload.  Due to the increased number of prosecutors, colonial governors, through their general law enforcement powers, had to direct these prosecutors and often did so by requiring them to enter a nolle prosequi on cases the governors thought did not merit prosecution.  Prosecutors also used the nolle prosequi to control criminal prosecutions they had begun if they later gathered information that indicated pursuing the prosecution was no longer just or proper.  \n",

The first national debate regarding the nolle prosequi stemmed from public response to presidential decisions made after an individual was arrested in February 1799 in South Carolina and accused of participating in a mutiny on a British ship.  This case caused a national outcry because citizens were concerned over the uneven use of the nolle prosequi and the amount of discretion at the executive branch’s disposal and discussion in Congress quickly followed regarding the discretion to nolle prosequi.  \n",

In 1944, Congress definitively ended the debate regarding the federal nolle prosequi by codifying judicial oversight of the federal nolle prosequi under Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  \n",

Some states also require court’s consent after an indictment is returned in an effort to protect the power and independence of the grand jury.  Finally, a prosecutor’s authority to nolle prosequi often returns once the trial has concluded with a guilty verdict because nolle prosequi at this stage no longer infringes upon defendant’s rights to due process.  \n",

Notwithstanding subtle nuances in every state, states fall within three major categories in the amount of autonomy given to prosecutors in their entry of a nolle prosequi.  The first category of states have given their prosecutors wide authority and autonomy to nolle prosequi with extremely limited oversight.  The next category of states have given judges the ability to curtail the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi power, albeit with varying conditions required.  The final category of states have limited or abolished the nolle prosequi and require a prosecutor to file a motion to dismiss in any situation where they would like to discontinue or abandon the case.  \n",

Alaska, Florida, Rhode Island, Nebraska, and Nevada courts have all interpreted that prosecutorial discretion is not subject to judicial review because the power is constitutionallybased.

These states vary as to whether they require a prosecutor to state their reasons on the record for the nolle prosequi.  Even though prosecutors are given complete discretion in these states, judicial review is still allowed and expected in certain specific situations that vary in each state but often include corruption, capricious or scandalous behavior, and infringement on defendants rights.  For example, in State v. Reimonenq, court acknowledged that the prosecutor had sole discretion to make decisions regarding prosecution, but stated that the prosecutorial decision to nolle prosequi the case and refile simply to organize their case upset the balance between the prosecutor’s discretion and the accused rights to such a degree that it violated the defendants right to due process and fundamental fairness.  \n",

Requiring prosecutors to state their reasons empowers citizens to vote based on prosecutorial decisions to nolle prosequi.  This requirement in no way hinders the prosecution if their motives are constitutional and uncorrupt.  \n",

      " democracy is dependent on elected representatives’ ability to perform the central duties of their office with discretion.  Although  largely behind the scenes, prosecutors have been able to use their discretion at various stages of litigation to ensure that laws faithfully executed, not just robotically so.  Handicapping the xecutive ranchs discretion and allowing the udicial ranch to interfere with the entry of any nolle prosequi outside of constitutional justifications or instances of corruption is a violation of separation of powers and threatens the quintessential balance of power our criminal justice system depends on.  Taking discretion away from locallyelected prosecutors also harms every voter who might wish to see the nolle prosequi used more or less often.  \n",

      "Imposing arbitrary judicial limits on prosecutorial discretion to enter a nolle prosequi not only harms the system at large, but individual defendants as well.  Our country currently faces a mass incarceration crisis which many prosecutors are attempting to fix.

      "Local prosecutors are the correct wielders of the discretion to nolle prosequi as elected servants.  The decision whether or not to prosecute should be made by prosecutors as part of their duty to faithfully execute the laws.  Local prosecutors elected status makes them accountable to the public for their decisions, including their decisions to nolle prosequi.  If the discretion to nolle prosequi is taken away from prosecutors, the power simply transfers to judges.  This leads to a fundamental upheaval of separation of powers in an unacceptable manner.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 62 \n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure that prosecutors remain accountable for their actions, certain fundamental safeguards must be put in place.  Voters should have the ability to review every reason for every nolle prosequi to make educated decisions when inside the ballot box.  Additionally, judges should be able to review the reasons for a nolle prosequi to ensure that the prosecutor hasn’t acted corruptly and to protect the defendant’s constitutional rights.  In sum, although every state is free to balance the separations of powers as they see fit, local prosecutors should be given discretion to nolle prosequi within constitutional limits while being statutorily required to explain their reasoning on the record.  This approach is the correct way to balance the Executive and Judicial powers and protects both defendants’ and voters’ rights and interests.  \n",

Legal Ethics 309, 316-17 (2001) (elucidating prosecutorial duty of truthfulness and obligation not to present false evidence).  The responsibilities of state grand juries vary, but often involve assessing the propriety of criminal charges.  See Susan W.

See id. at 67 (explaining relationship between grand jury and judicial branch).  The goal of many state grand jury systems is to provide criminal defendants additional protection from prosecutors.  See id. at 70-71 (contextualizing historical relationship between grand jury and defendant’s right to indictment); see also State v. Winne, 96 A.2d 63, 76 (N.J. 1953) (affirming state constitution requires indictment before state holds defendant to answer for criminal offense).  Other states have eliminated or reduced the importance of grand juries due to an increasing belief that they are unnecessary because of professional criminal prosecutors.

Pol. & Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 343, 343 (2010) (connecting relationship between high incarceration and prosecutorial discretion).  In 2019, the total prison population in the United States was 1,430,800, which is often described by experts as a mass incarceration crisis.  See U.S. Dep’t of Just., Prisoners in 2019, 1 (2020), https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p19.pdf, [https://perma.cc/NB66-5DLG] (comparing prison population trends over several years); Traum, supra note 2, at 425 (defining mass incarceration and arguing harmful and destabilizing effects on communities); Mirko Bagaric et al., Mitigating America’s Mass Incarceration Crisis Without Compromising Community Protection:  Expanding the Role of Rehabilitation in Sentencing, 22 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 3, 59 (2018) (concluding the United States experiencing unprecedented mass incarceration crisis).  In the past ten years, prosecutors have examined the operation of the criminal justice and pushed for alternatives to incarceration.  See Yaroshefsky, supra at 343-45 (noting state initiatives with reform focus).  These alternatives include community service, electronic monitoring, probation, restitution, or treatment.  See generally James Austin, A Guidelines Proposal:  How Many Americans are Unnecessarily Incarcerated?, 29 Fed. Sent. R. 140 (2017) (considering proposed alternatives to incarceration and arguing their superior effectiveness).  Many experts assert that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi, should be used to end the mass incarceration crisis in the United States.  See Jeffrey Bellin, Reassessing Prosecutorial Power Through the Lens of Mass Incarceration, 116 Mich. L. Rev. 835, 836 (2018) (articulating legal expert’s opinion that prosecutors can alleviate damage caused by mass incarceration); Angela J. Davis, The Prosecutor’s Ethical Duty to End Mass Incarceration, 44 Hofstra L. Rev. 1063, 1085 (2016) (concluding prosecutors have ethical duty to end mass incarceration).  Other experts feel that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi has played a significant role in causing the mass incarceration crisis.

      "\tOver the last few years, people have elected many progressive district attorneys on a platform of ending mass incarceration.  One of the primary tools these progressive: district attorneys have utilized to further this goal is the nolle prosequi.  The nolle prosequi is “an entry on a record in a criminal case file that the prosecutor or court has discontinued the case.”  When given complete discretion to nolle prosequi, the prosecutor has total control over when charges are dismissed prior to trial and even post-conviction .  \n",

      "\tDespite its influential nature, there is not one unifying theory on the amount of discretion prosecutors should have when it comes to the use of the nolle prosequi.  Many state judicial branches view the power of the nolle prosequi as quintessential to a prosecutor’s authority.  Others consider judicial oversight to be necessary to prevent evil and corrupt prosecutors from using the nolle prosequi inappropriately.  Seven states have decided that the nolle prosequi is too dangerous and have abolished it all together.  Seventeen states have required prosecutors to obtain the court’s consent, otherwise known as leave of court, prior to exercising their discretion not to prosecute.  Still others have limited the power of prosecutors only in situations where bad faith is clearly shown.  \n",

      "This Note will examine the history of the nolle prosequi as a tool of prosecutorial discretion and how it implicates the power of both state and federal executive branches, judicial branches, and the grand jury.  It begins by outlining a national census as to different states approaches to judicial oversight of the nolle prosequi.  This Note then discuses the limits and benefits of each of these approaches and argues that judicial oversight of prosecutorial discretion not to prosecute should be limited to circumstances of prosecutorial corruption and infringement of defendant’s rights.  Finally, this Note concludes by recommending limited judicial oversight while requiring prosecutors state their reasoning on the record to balance both the autonomy of prosecutors as elected officials and the sanctity of defendants’ rights.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 10 \n",
      "\n",
      "\tBoth state and federal prosecutors are government officials within the executive branch responsible for reviewing evidence and assisting criminal investigations.  A prosecutor is also responsible for determining whom to prosecute based on the sufficiency of the evidence.  Finally, prosecutors are responsible for overseeing prosecutions according to applicable constitutions, statutes, and precedent.  The Supreme Court  has described prosecutors as “the servant[s] of the law” tasked to both punish the guilty and ensure that the innocent do not suffer.  Federally, the executive branch has a constitutional duty to make sure that laws passed by the legislative branch are faithfully executed.  \n",

      "\n",
      "In response to the requirements of the Constitution, Congress created the Office of the Attorney General by enacting the Judiciary Act of 1789.  At the time, the attorney general was only responsible for representing the United States in court and advising the president and agency heads on questions of law.  The attorney general’s original obligations were limited to cases argued in front of the Supreme Court.  Federal district attorneys, known today as U.S. attorneys, were initially responsible for the representation of the United States in local district and circuit courts.  The Attorney General, under the Judiciary act of 1789, had no authority over these federal district attorneys.  In 1861, however, the attorney general was given statutory power over these federal district attorneys and could control how they went about their prosecutions.  In 1870, the Department of Justice was created to assist the attorney general in their duties and solidified the attorney general as the head.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 12 \n",
      "\n",
      "\tState constitutions, modeled after the U.S. Constitution, grant state executive branches the responsibility to make sure that “the laws be faithfully executed.”  This duty is carried out by state attorney generals and local prosecutors.  Most states vest the attorney general with exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction over a specific number of limited issues, such as cases involving public corruption, fraud, regulatory crimes, or when local prosecutors have conflicts of interests.  The vast majority of states hold elections for local prosecutors who oversee prosecutions within a geographic-based jurisdiction that fall outside the state attorney general’s responsibility.  \n",

      "\n",
      "\tBecause prosecutors are solely responsible for determining which criminal cases to charge and how to proceed with the litigation, the prosecutor’s personal judgement, otherwise known as prosecutorial discretion, can change the direction of a case.  Prosecutors’ status as elected officials allowed local prosecutors to exercise more of their own, individual discretion in enforcing the laws because they were no longer subject to the varying opinions and politics of those who appointed them.  By 1912, forty-eight states had local prosecutors, all but five of which were elected.  There was an increase in crime shortly after World War I, which shined a spotlight on prosecutors and led to a national reexamination of the state prosecutor’s role.  Both local and federal crime commissions were created across the country to lead this examination and found that the elective nature of local prosecutors led to undue influence from inappropriate sources.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 15 \n",
      "\n",
      "From the first allegations of criminal conduct to the end of a criminal case, prosecutors have several key moments when they may use their discretion to alter the course of a case.  Currently, there is no universal requirement for prosecutors to publicly state how they use this discretion.  Although prosecutors are not required to publicly report on how they use their discretion, several independent groups have begun to collect data on the prosecutorial exercise of discretion to allow voters to make educated decisions.  Additionally, advocates are fighting for laws which would increase prosecutorial transparency and would require prosecutors to report data on defendants throughout all stages of litigation.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 16 \n",
      "\n",
      "First, during an investigation, a prosecutor can exercise discretion by guiding police toward certain lines of investigation and by deciding whether to use subpoenas and warrants to obtain new evidence.  Much of the modern prosecutor’s time is spent exercising discretion during the investigation of criminal charges and making important investigative decisions.  The Supreme Court has recognized that the prosecutor’s role as an advocate for the state extends to investigative actions outside the courtroom setting.  Other than ethical concerns and constitutional limitations, decision making at this phase is without judicial oversight both to give the prosecutor a necessary amount of autonomy and because oversight at this phase would be practically infeasible.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 17 \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, before charges are filed, prosecutors use their discretion to decide what charges to bring based on the evidence, the prosecutor’s doubts, and the public interest.  After the investigation, the decision whether or not to prosecute and the decision of what charges to file or bring before a grand jury generally rests entirely in the prosecutor’s discretion.  The prosecutor must weigh the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence policies, enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to any overall enforcement plan.  Because the factors the prosecutor weighs in each case are ill-suited for judicial oversight, discretion at this phase is naturally very broad.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 18 \n",
      "\n",
      "Third, during plea bargaining prosecutor’s use their discretion to decide what offers to make to defendants and which of the defendants offers to accept.  There is no constitutional right to plea bargain, and the prosecutor does not need to participate in any negotiation if the prosecutor prefers to go to trial.  Nevertheless, state prosecutors rely on discretion during plea bargaining and nearly 90% of all criminal cases in the United States end in plea agreements.  Prosecutors have been allowed broad discretion in this stage of litigation because judges are free to accept or not accept guilty pleas and have full control of sentencing.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 19 \n",

      "Fourth, during grand jury proceedings and during and before trial, the prosecutor may choose how best to present evidence of guilt and decide which proper arguments to put forward.  Prosecutors have wide latitude to present evidence and make any proper legal arguments in whatever manner they feel is best.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 20 \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, after charges have been filed, prosecutors may use their discretion to decide to discontinue or abandon a pending case.  During litigation, prosecutors have the ability to discontinue or abandon a case through either filing a motion to dismiss the case or a nolle prosequi.  Federal prosecutors have wide latitude concerning when to formally dismiss charges, although leave of court is still necessary.  Some federal circuits have held that judges may withhold leave of court only if the prosecutor’s request is clearly contrary to manifest public interest.  State courts also require judicial approval for any dismissal and have similar standards for when a judge may withhold consent.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 22 \n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors can similarly enter a nolle prosequi, either with or without the consent of court depending on the jurisdiction, to end a criminal case in favor of the accused.  The prosecution may reopen a case in which they have entered a nolle prosequi with a new indictment if the new charges are within the statute of limitations period.  Both federally and on the state level, the prosecution may enter a nolle prosequi any time before jeopardy attaches, which occurs when the jury is empaneled or, in a nonjury trial, when the court has begun hearing evidence.  Although a nolle prosequi is similar to a motion to dismiss, the requirements for charges to be abandoned via a nolle prosequi vary greatly in each jurisdiction and can have serious implications on prosecutorial autonomy.  Although many courts and statutes use the terms nolle prosequi and motion for dismissal interchangeably, the difference is that prosecutors discretion varies across jurisdictions when filing a nolle prosequi, but must always seek the court’s consent when filing a motion to dismiss.  \n",

      "Around the Sixteenth Century, the nolle prosequi began in England as a procedural device that the royally-appointed attorney general could use to terminate an ongoing criminal prosecution.  During this period, the public prosecuted most offenses and accordingly many prosecutions were frivolous.  The attorney general in England used the nolle prosequi to dismiss prosecutions that they regarded as frivolous or in contravention of royal interests.  This power was entirely within the domain of the attorney general and thus no form of judicial review existed.  \n",

The American colonies established a system for processing official prosecutions that was extremely complex and required more prosecutors to handle the increased workload.  Due to the increased number of prosecutors, colonial governors, through their general law enforcement powers, had to direct these prosecutors and often did so by requiring them to enter a nolle prosequi on cases the governors thought did not merit prosecution.  Prosecutors also used the nolle prosequi to control criminal prosecutions they had begun if they later gathered information that indicated pursuing the prosecution was no longer just or proper.  \n",

      "Debate over the amount of power the federal executive branch should have to use the nolle prosequi began shortly after the United States was founded.  The first national debate regarding the nolle prosequi stemmed from public response to presidential decisions made after an individual was arrested in February 1799 in South Carolina and accused of participating in a mutiny on a British ship.  This case caused a national outcry because citizens were concerned over the uneven use of the nolle prosequi and the amount of discretion at the executive branch’s disposal and discussion in Congress quickly followed regarding the discretion to nolle prosequi.  \n",

Congressman John Marshall argued the executive branch had the power to enter a nolle prosequi and that the court was powerless to review or deny its entry.  In 1944, Congress definitively ended the debate regarding the federal nolle prosequi by codifying judicial oversight of the federal nolle prosequi under Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  \n",

Some states also require court’s consent after an indictment is returned in an effort to protect the power and independence of the grand jury.  Finally, a prosecutor’s authority to nolle prosequi often returns once the trial has concluded with a guilty verdict because nolle prosequi at this stage no longer infringes upon defendant’s rights to due process.  \n",

Notwithstanding subtle nuances in every state, states fall within three major categories in the amount of autonomy given to prosecutors in their entry of a nolle prosequi.  The first category of states have given their prosecutors wide authority and autonomy to nolle prosequi with extremely limited oversight.  The next category of states have given judges the ability to curtail the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi power, albeit with varying conditions required.  The final category of states have limited or abolished the nolle prosequi and require a prosecutor to file a motion to dismiss in any situation where they would like to discontinue or abandon the case.  \n",

      "Many states’ constitution directly or indirectly grant prosecutors the discretion to nolle prosequi.  Alaska, Florida, Rhode Island, Nebraska, and Nevada courts have all interpreted that prosecutorial discretion is not subject to judicial review because the power is constitutionallybased.  In these states, the courts have no ability to decline the entry of a nolle prosequi unless the nolle prosequi impedes on the defendant’s rights or is inherently unconstitutional.  \n",

DC, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, and South Dakota all currently allow prosecutors to enter nolle prosequis with no, or very little judicial, oversight.  These states vary as to whether they require a prosecutor to state their reasons on the record for the nolle prosequi.  Even though prosecutors are given complete discretion in these states, judicial review is still allowed and expected in certain specific situations that vary in each state but often include corruption, capricious or scandalous behavior, and infringement on defendants rights.  For example, in State v. Reimonenq, court acknowledged that the prosecutor had sole discretion to make decisions regarding prosecution, but stated that the prosecutorial decision to nolle prosequi the case and refile simply to organize their case upset the balance between the prosecutor’s discretion and the accused rights to such a degree that it violated the defendants right to due process and fundamental fairness.  \n",

A final problem to this approach for states that do not require the prosecutor to state their reasoning on the record is that voters will be unable to make informed decisions based on the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi usage.  \n",

      "States that have given judges the ability to curtail the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi power incorrectly limit the xecutive ranch’s ability to ensure that he laws be faithfully executed.  Giving prosecutors discretion allows voters to remedy prosecution policy viewed as either too harsh or too lenient by voting based on said policy.  Allowing judges to curtail that discretion simply hinders the ability of the voters to correct problematic prosecutorial decision making on a larger scale.  One benefit to this approach, however, is that individual defendants are much more protected and less likely to be caught up in the passing whim of the voters.  \n",

      "States that have abolished or limited the nolle prosequi have inappropriately removed a tool prosecutors have relied on since before the founding of America.  In practice, states that have abolished the nolle prosequi behave similarly to states that require leave of court because a motion to dismiss also requires the court’s approval.  States that have limited the nolle prosequi to specific situations also behave similarly to states that require leave of court because a motion to dismiss is required for in any unspecified circumstances.  Both of these categories accordingly have the same benefits and shortcomings as states that have given judges the ability to curtail the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi power.  \n",

      "All states recognize that there are certain situations where the entry of a nolle prosequi is inappropriate, and an ideal balance would also recognize these limitations.  Judges must be able to intervene if the prosecutor’s  nolle prosequi is deemed unconstitutional.  This also means that judges must be impowered to protect defendants rights.  To ensure that no individual defendant not injured or improperly benefit from inappropriate exercise prosecutorial discretion, judges must be able to intervene if there is undisputed evidence of corruption.  Judges should not, however, be impowered to intervene in instances of “scandalous behavior,” as any ability to do so might invite inappropriate judicial encroachment into the power of the xecutive ranch.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 55 \n",
      "\n",
      "As elected representatives, however, the prosecutors should have full autonomy outside of these limited exceptions to decide when to nolle prosequi.  Allowing prosecutors discretion is consistent with the historical use of the nolle prosequi.  Broad discretion to nolle prosequi would also be consistent with the amount of prosecutorial discretion allowed during other stages of litigation.  Many states already give prosecutors this appropriate amount of discretion.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 56 \n",
      "\n",
      "The main drawback to allowing prosecutors discretion is the risk of undetected corruption or unconstitutional motives.  This can easily be avoided if prosecutors are made publicly accountable by being statutorily required to state their reasons on the record.  Requiring prosecutors to state their reasons empowers citizens to vote based on prosecutorial decisions to nolle prosequi.  This requirement in no way hinders the prosecution if their motives are constitutional and uncorrupt.  \n",

Although  largely behind the scenes, prosecutors have been able to use their discretion at various stages of litigation to ensure that laws faithfully executed, not just robotically so.  Handicapping the xecutive ranchs discretion and allowing the udicial ranch to interfere with the entry of any nolle prosequi outside of constitutional justifications or instances of corruption is a violation of separation of powers and threatens the quintessential balance of power our criminal justice system depends on.  Taking discretion away from locallyelected prosecutors also harms every voter who might wish to see the nolle prosequi used more or less often.  \n",

      "Local prosecutors are the correct wielders of the discretion to nolle prosequi as elected servants.  The decision whether or not to prosecute should be made by prosecutors as part of their duty to faithfully execute the laws.  Local prosecutors elected status makes them accountable to the public for their decisions, including their decisions to nolle prosequi.  If the discretion to nolle prosequi is taken away from prosecutors, the power simply transfers to judges.  This leads to a fundamental upheaval of separation of powers in an unacceptable manner.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 62 \n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure that prosecutors remain accountable for their actions, certain fundamental safeguards must be put in place.  Voters should have the ability to review every reason for every nolle prosequi to make educated decisions when inside the ballot box.  Additionally, judges should be able to review the reasons for a nolle prosequi to ensure that the prosecutor hasn’t acted corruptly and to protect the defendant’s constitutional rights.  In sum, although every state is free to balance the separations of powers as they see fit, local prosecutors should be given discretion to nolle prosequi within constitutional limits while being statutorily required to explain their reasoning on the record.  This approach is the correct way to balance the Executive and Judicial powers and protects both defendants’ and voters’ rights and interests.  \n",

Pol. & Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 343, 343 (2010) (connecting relationship between high incarceration and prosecutorial discretion).  In 2019, the total prison population in the United States was 1,430,800, which is often described by experts as a mass incarceration crisis.  See U.S. Dep’t of Just., Prisoners in 2019, 1 (2020), https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p19.pdf, [https://perma.cc/NB66-5DLG] (comparing prison population trends over several years); Traum, supra note 2, at 425 (defining mass incarceration and arguing harmful and destabilizing effects on communities); Mirko Bagaric et al., Mitigating America’s Mass Incarceration Crisis Without Compromising Community Protection:  Expanding the Role of Rehabilitation in Sentencing, 22 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 3, 59 (2018) (concluding the United States experiencing unprecedented mass incarceration crisis).  In the past ten years, prosecutors have examined the operation of the criminal justice and pushed for alternatives to incarceration.  See Yaroshefsky, supra at 343-45 (noting state initiatives with reform focus).  These alternatives include community service, electronic monitoring, probation, restitution, or treatment.  See generally James Austin, A Guidelines Proposal:  How Many Americans are Unnecessarily Incarcerated?, 29 Fed. Sent. R. 140 (2017) (considering proposed alternatives to incarceration and arguing their superior effectiveness).  Many experts assert that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi, should be used to end the mass incarceration crisis in the United States.  See Jeffrey Bellin, Reassessing Prosecutorial Power Through the Lens of Mass Incarceration, 116 Mich. L. Rev. 835, 836 (2018) (articulating legal expert’s opinion that prosecutors can alleviate damage caused by mass incarceration); Angela J. Davis, The Prosecutor’s Ethical Duty to End Mass Incarceration, 44 Hofstra L. Rev. 1063, 1085 (2016) (concluding prosecutors have ethical duty to end mass incarceration).  Other experts feel that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi has played a significant role in causing the mass incarceration crisis.

One of the primary tools these progressive: district attorneys have utilized to further this goal is the nolle prosequi.  The nolle prosequi is “an entry on a record in a criminal case file that the prosecutor or court has discontinued the case.”  When given complete discretion to nolle prosequi, the prosecutor has total control over when charges are dismissed prior to trial and even post-conviction .  \n",

Many state judicial branches view the power of the nolle prosequi as quintessential to a prosecutor’s authority.  Others consider judicial oversight to be necessary to prevent evil and corrupt prosecutors from using the nolle prosequi inappropriately.  Seven states have decided that the nolle prosequi is too dangerous and have abolished it all together.  Seventeen states have required prosecutors to obtain the court’s consent, otherwise known as leave of court, prior to exercising their discretion not to prosecute.  Still others have limited the power of prosecutors only in situations where bad faith is clearly shown.  \n",

It begins by outlining a national census as to different states approaches to judicial oversight of the nolle prosequi.  This Note then discuses the limits and benefits of each of these approaches and argues that judicial oversight of prosecutorial discretion not to prosecute should be limited to circumstances of prosecutorial corruption and infringement of defendant’s rights.  Finally, this Note concludes by recommending limited judicial oversight while requiring prosecutors state their reasoning on the record to balance both the autonomy of prosecutors as elected officials and the sanctity of defendants’ rights.  \n",

      "\tBoth state and federal prosecutors are government officials within the executive branch responsible for reviewing evidence and assisting criminal investigations.  A prosecutor is also responsible for determining whom to prosecute based on the sufficiency of the evidence.  Finally, prosecutors are responsible for overseeing prosecutions according to applicable constitutions, statutes, and precedent.  The Supreme Court  has described prosecutors as “the servant[s] of the law” tasked to both punish the guilty and ensure that the innocent do not suffer.  Federally, the executive branch has a constitutional duty to make sure that laws passed by the legislative branch are faithfully executed.  \n",

      "In response to the requirements of the Constitution, Congress created the Office of the Attorney General by enacting the Judiciary Act of 1789.  At the time, the attorney general was only responsible for representing the United States in court and advising the president and agency heads on questions of law.  The attorney general’s original obligations were limited to cases argued in front of the Supreme Court.  Federal district attorneys, known today as U.S. attorneys, were initially responsible for the representation of the United States in local district and circuit courts.  The Attorney General, under the Judiciary act of 1789, had no authority over these federal district attorneys.  In 1861, however, the attorney general was given statutory power over these federal district attorneys and could control how they went about their prosecutions.  In 1870, the Department of Justice was created to assist the attorney general in their duties and solidified the attorney general as the head.  \n",

      "\tState constitutions, modeled after the U.S. Constitution, grant state executive branches the responsibility to make sure that “the laws be faithfully executed.”  This duty is carried out by state attorney generals and local prosecutors.  Most states vest the attorney general with exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction over a specific number of limited issues, such as cases involving public corruption, fraud, regulatory crimes, or when local prosecutors have conflicts of interests.  The vast majority of states hold elections for local prosecutors who oversee prosecutions within a geographic-based jurisdiction that fall outside the state attorney general’s responsibility.  \n",

      "\n",
      "\tBecause prosecutors are solely responsible for determining which criminal cases to charge and how to proceed with the litigation, the prosecutor’s personal judgement, otherwise known as prosecutorial discretion, can change the direction of a case.  Prosecutors’ status as elected officials allowed local prosecutors to exercise more of their own, individual discretion in enforcing the laws because they were no longer subject to the varying opinions and politics of those who appointed them.  By 1912, forty-eight states had local prosecutors, all but five of which were elected.  There was an increase in crime shortly after World War I, which shined a spotlight on prosecutors and led to a national reexamination of the state prosecutor’s role.  Both local and federal crime commissions were created across the country to lead this examination and found that the elective nature of local prosecutors led to undue influence from inappropriate sources.  \n",

      "\n",
      "From the first allegations of criminal conduct to the end of a criminal case, prosecutors have several key moments when they may use their discretion to alter the course of a case.  Currently, there is no universal requirement for prosecutors to publicly state how they use this discretion.  Although prosecutors are not required to publicly report on how they use their discretion, several independent groups have begun to collect data on the prosecutorial exercise of discretion to allow voters to make educated decisions.  Additionally, advocates are fighting for laws which would increase prosecutorial transparency and would require prosecutors to report data on defendants throughout all stages of litigation.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 16 \n",
      "\n",
      "First, during an investigation, a prosecutor can exercise discretion by guiding police toward certain lines of investigation and by deciding whether to use subpoenas and warrants to obtain new evidence.  Much of the modern prosecutor’s time is spent exercising discretion during the investigation of criminal charges and making important investigative decisions.  The Supreme Court has recognized that the prosecutor’s role as an advocate for the state extends to investigative actions outside the courtroom setting.  Other than ethical concerns and constitutional limitations, decision making at this phase is without judicial oversight both to give the prosecutor a necessary amount of autonomy and because oversight at this phase would be practically infeasible.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 17 \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, before charges are filed, prosecutors use their discretion to decide what charges to bring based on the evidence, the prosecutor’s doubts, and the public interest.  After the investigation, the decision whether or not to prosecute and the decision of what charges to file or bring before a grand jury generally rests entirely in the prosecutor’s discretion.  The prosecutor must weigh the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence policies, enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to any overall enforcement plan.  Because the factors the prosecutor weighs in each case are ill-suited for judicial oversight, discretion at this phase is naturally very broad.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 18 \n",
      "\n",
      "Third, during plea bargaining prosecutor’s use their discretion to decide what offers to make to defendants and which of the defendants offers to accept.  There is no constitutional right to plea bargain, and the prosecutor does not need to participate in any negotiation if the prosecutor prefers to go to trial.  Nevertheless, state prosecutors rely on discretion during plea bargaining and nearly 90% of all criminal cases in the United States end in plea agreements.  Prosecutors have been allowed broad discretion in this stage of litigation because judges are free to accept or not accept guilty pleas and have full control of sentencing.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 20 \n",

      "Finally, after charges have been filed, prosecutors may use their discretion to decide to discontinue or abandon a pending case.  During litigation, prosecutors have the ability to discontinue or abandon a case through either filing a motion to dismiss the case or a nolle prosequi.  Federal prosecutors have wide latitude concerning when to formally dismiss charges, although leave of court is still necessary.  Some federal circuits have held that judges may withhold leave of court only if the prosecutor’s request is clearly contrary to manifest public interest.  State courts also require judicial approval for any dismissal and have similar standards for when a judge may withhold consent.  \n",

The prosecution may reopen a case in which they have entered a nolle prosequi with a new indictment if the new charges are within the statute of limitations period.  Both federally and on the state level, the prosecution may enter a nolle prosequi any time before jeopardy attaches, which occurs when the jury is empaneled or, in a nonjury trial, when the court has begun hearing evidence.  Although a nolle prosequi is similar to a motion to dismiss, the requirements for charges to be abandoned via a nolle prosequi vary greatly in each jurisdiction and can have serious implications on prosecutorial autonomy.  Although many courts and statutes use the terms nolle prosequi and motion for dismissal interchangeably, the difference is that prosecutors discretion varies across jurisdictions when filing a nolle prosequi, but must always seek the court’s consent when filing a motion to dismiss.  \n",

      "Around the Sixteenth Century, the nolle prosequi began in England as a procedural device that the royally-appointed attorney general could use to terminate an ongoing criminal prosecution.  During this period, the public prosecuted most offenses and accordingly many prosecutions were frivolous.  The attorney general in England used the nolle prosequi to dismiss prosecutions that they regarded as frivolous or in contravention of royal interests.  This power was entirely within the domain of the attorney general and thus no form of judicial review existed.  \n",

      "The American-colonial system differed from the English system because American colonies had many more prosecutors than England.  The American colonies established a system for processing official prosecutions that was extremely complex and required more prosecutors to handle the increased workload.  Due to the increased number of prosecutors, colonial governors, through their general law enforcement powers, had to direct these prosecutors and often did so by requiring them to enter a nolle prosequi on cases the governors thought did not merit prosecution.  Prosecutors also used the nolle prosequi to control criminal prosecutions they had begun if they later gathered information that indicated pursuing the prosecution was no longer just or proper.  \n",

      "Debate over the amount of power the federal executive branch should have to use the nolle prosequi began shortly after the United States was founded.  The first national debate regarding the nolle prosequi stemmed from public response to presidential decisions made after an individual was arrested in February 1799 in South Carolina and accused of participating in a mutiny on a British ship.  This case caused a national outcry because citizens were concerned over the uneven use of the nolle prosequi and the amount of discretion at the executive branch’s disposal and discussion in Congress quickly followed regarding the discretion to nolle prosequi.  \n",

In 1944, Congress definitively ended the debate regarding the federal nolle prosequi by codifying judicial oversight of the federal nolle prosequi under Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  \n",

Although the responsibilities and obligations of state grand juries vary, they often are tasked with assessing the propriety of criminal charges.  See Susan W.

Some states also require court’s consent after an indictment is returned in an effort to protect the power and independence of the grand jury.  Finally, a prosecutor’s authority to nolle prosequi often returns once the trial has concluded with a guilty verdict because nolle prosequi at this stage no longer infringes upon defendant’s rights to due process.  \n",

Notwithstanding subtle nuances in every state, states fall within three major categories in the amount of autonomy given to prosecutors in their entry of a nolle prosequi.  The first category of states have given their prosecutors wide authority and autonomy to nolle prosequi with extremely limited oversight.  The next category of states have given judges the ability to curtail the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi power, albeit with varying conditions required.  The final category of states have limited or abolished the nolle prosequi and require a prosecutor to file a motion to dismiss in any situation where they would like to discontinue or abandon the case.  \n",

      "Many states’ constitution directly or indirectly grant prosecutors the discretion to nolle prosequi.  Alaska, Florida, Rhode Island, Nebraska, and Nevada courts have all interpreted that prosecutorial discretion is not subject to judicial review because the power is constitutionallybased.  In these states, the courts have no ability to decline the entry of a nolle prosequi unless the nolle prosequi impedes on the defendant’s rights or is inherently unconstitutional.  \n",

DC, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, and South Dakota all currently allow prosecutors to enter nolle prosequis with no, or very little judicial, oversight.  These states vary as to whether they require a prosecutor to state their reasons on the record for the nolle prosequi.  Even though prosecutors are given complete discretion in these states, judicial review is still allowed and expected in certain specific situations that vary in each state but often include corruption, capricious or scandalous behavior, and infringement on defendants rights.  For example, in State v. Reimonenq, court acknowledged that the prosecutor had sole discretion to make decisions regarding prosecution, but stated that the prosecutorial decision to nolle prosequi the case and refile simply to organize their case upset the balance between the prosecutor’s discretion and the accused rights to such a degree that it violated the defendants right to due process and fundamental fairness.  \n",

Other states, such as Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania have allowed courts to have much wider discretion to withhold consent as they see fit.

      "In Massachusetts, the courts recently had to decide the amount of autonomy prosecutors are allowed when attempting to use the nolle prosequi to address mass incarceration.  During a “Straight Pride Parade” in Boston, several protestors were arrested and the local District Attorney, Rachel Rollins, sought to have the non-violent offender’s cases dismissed through a nolle prosequi.  The trial judge denied the Commonwealth’s nolle prosequi on the charge of disorderly conduct.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court found that the trial judge had no authority to deny the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi.   The court contemplated that curtailment of the power to nolle prosequi may be allowed in “instances of scandalous abuse of authority,” of which this was not one.  \n",

No approach is perfect and experts can disagree about how to properly balance the nolle prosequi’s power to respect the exclusive domain of the xecutive ranch, the udicial ranch, and the rand ury.

      "States that have given their prosecutors autonomy to nolle prosequi with limited judicial oversight correctly allow their prosecutors to act as elected representatives.  One problem to this approach is that it may make trial judges unwilling to investigate the reasons behind a nolle prosequi.  This could potentially lead to undiscovered corruption or accidental infringement on defendants rights.   courts utilizing this approach tend to be unwilling to discuss or define corrupt or scandalous behavior, which may leave trial judges unable to recognize abuses of authority when they see it.  A final problem to this approach for states that do not require the prosecutor to state their reasoning on the record is that voters will be unable to make informed decisions based on the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi usage.  \n",

      "States that have given judges the ability to curtail the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi power incorrectly limit the xecutive ranch’s ability to ensure that he laws be faithfully executed.  Giving prosecutors discretion allows voters to remedy prosecution policy viewed as either too harsh or too lenient by voting based on said policy.  Allowing judges to curtail that discretion simply hinders the ability of the voters to correct problematic prosecutorial decision making on a larger scale.  One benefit to this approach, however, is that individual defendants are much more protected and less likely to be caught up in the passing whim of the voters.  \n",

      "States that have abolished or limited the nolle prosequi have inappropriately removed a tool prosecutors have relied on since before the founding of America.  In practice, states that have abolished the nolle prosequi behave similarly to states that require leave of court because a motion to dismiss also requires the court’s approval.  States that have limited the nolle prosequi to specific situations also behave similarly to states that require leave of court because a motion to dismiss is required for in any unspecified circumstances.

Judges must be able to intervene if the prosecutor’s  nolle prosequi is deemed unconstitutional.  This also means that judges must be impowered to protect defendants rights.  To ensure that no individual defendant not injured or improperly benefit from inappropriate exercise prosecutorial discretion, judges must be able to intervene if there is undisputed evidence of corruption.  Judges should not, however, be impowered to intervene in instances of “scandalous behavior,” as any ability to do so might invite inappropriate judicial encroachment into the power of the xecutive ranch.  \n",

      "The main drawback to allowing prosecutors discretion is the risk of undetected corruption or unconstitutional motives.  This can easily be avoided if prosecutors are made publicly accountable by being statutorily required to state their reasons on the record.  Requiring prosecutors to state their reasons empowers citizens to vote based on prosecutorial decisions to nolle prosequi.

Handicapping the xecutive ranchs discretion and allowing the udicial ranch to interfere with the entry of any nolle prosequi outside of constitutional justifications or instances of corruption is a violation of separation of powers and threatens the quintessential balance of power our criminal justice system depends on.

      "Local prosecutors are the correct wielders of the discretion to nolle prosequi as elected servants.  The decision whether or not to prosecute should be made by prosecutors as part of their duty to faithfully execute the laws.  Local prosecutors elected status makes them accountable to the public for their decisions, including their decisions to nolle prosequi.  If the discretion to nolle prosequi is taken away from prosecutors, the power simply transfers to judges.  This leads to a fundamental upheaval of separation of powers in an unacceptable manner.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 62 \n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure that prosecutors remain accountable for their actions, certain fundamental safeguards must be put in place.  Voters should have the ability to review every reason for every nolle prosequi to make educated decisions when inside the ballot box.  Additionally, judges should be able to review the reasons for a nolle prosequi to ensure that the prosecutor hasn’t acted corruptly and to protect the defendant’s constitutional rights.  In sum, although every state is free to balance the separations of powers as they see fit, local prosecutors should be given discretion to nolle prosequi within constitutional limits while being statutorily required to explain their reasoning on the record.  This approach is the correct way to balance the Executive and Judicial powers and protects both defendants’ and voters’ rights and interests.  \n",

Pol. & Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 343, 343 (2010) (connecting relationship between high incarceration and prosecutorial discretion).  In 2019, the total prison population in the United States was 1,430,800, which is often described by experts as a mass incarceration crisis.  See U.S. Dep’t of Just., Prisoners in 2019, 1 (2020), https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p19.pdf, [https://perma.cc/NB66-5DLG] (comparing prison population trends over several years); Traum, supra note 2, at 425 (defining mass incarceration and arguing harmful and destabilizing effects on communities); Mirko Bagaric et al., Mitigating America’s Mass Incarceration Crisis Without Compromising Community Protection:  Expanding the Role of Rehabilitation in Sentencing, 22 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 3, 59 (2018) (concluding the United States experiencing unprecedented mass incarceration crisis).  In the past ten years, prosecutors have examined the operation of the criminal justice and pushed for alternatives to incarceration.  See Yaroshefsky, supra at 343-45 (noting state initiatives with reform focus).  These alternatives include community service, electronic monitoring, probation, restitution, or treatment.  See generally James Austin, A Guidelines Proposal:  How Many Americans are Unnecessarily Incarcerated?, 29 Fed. Sent. R. 140 (2017) (considering proposed alternatives to incarceration and arguing their superior effectiveness).  Many experts assert that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi, should be used to end the mass incarceration crisis in the United States.  See Jeffrey Bellin, Reassessing Prosecutorial Power Through the Lens of Mass Incarceration, 116 Mich. L. Rev. 835, 836 (2018) (articulating legal expert’s opinion that prosecutors can alleviate damage caused by mass incarceration); Angela J. Davis, The Prosecutor’s Ethical Duty to End Mass Incarceration, 44 Hofstra L. Rev. 1063, 1085 (2016) (concluding prosecutors have ethical duty to end mass incarceration).  Other experts feel that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi has played a significant role in causing the mass incarceration crisis.  See Bellin, supra at 836 (highlighting role many experts believe prosecutors played in causing mass incarceration crisis); Davis, supra at 1085 (blaming prosecutors for mass incarceration crisis).  \n",

      "\tOver the last few years, people have elected many progressive district attorneys on a platform of ending mass incarceration.  One of the primary tools these progressive: district attorneys have utilized to further this goal is the nolle prosequi.  The nolle prosequi is “an entry on a record in a criminal case file that the prosecutor or court has discontinued the case.”  When given complete discretion to nolle prosequi, the prosecutor has total control over when charges are dismissed prior to trial and even post-conviction .  \n",

      "\n",
      "\tDespite its influential nature, there is not one unifying theory on the amount of discretion prosecutors should have when it comes to the use of the nolle prosequi.  Many state judicial branches view the power of the nolle prosequi as quintessential to a prosecutor’s authority.  Others consider judicial oversight to be necessary to prevent evil and corrupt prosecutors from using the nolle prosequi inappropriately.  Seven states have decided that the nolle prosequi is too dangerous and have abolished it all together.  Seventeen states have required prosecutors to obtain the court’s consent, otherwise known as leave of court, prior to exercising their discretion not to prosecute.  Still others have limited the power of prosecutors only in situations where bad faith is clearly shown.  \n",

      "\n",
      "This Note will examine the history of the nolle prosequi as a tool of prosecutorial discretion and how it implicates the power of both state and federal executive branches, judicial branches, and the grand jury.  It begins by outlining a national census as to different states approaches to judicial oversight of the nolle prosequi.  This Note then discuses the limits and benefits of each of these approaches and argues that judicial oversight of prosecutorial discretion not to prosecute should be limited to circumstances of prosecutorial corruption and infringement of defendant’s rights.  Finally, this Note concludes by recommending limited judicial oversight while requiring prosecutors state their reasoning on the record to balance both the autonomy of prosecutors as elected officials and the sanctity of defendants’ rights.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 10 \n",
      "\n",
      "\tBoth state and federal prosecutors are government officials within the executive branch responsible for reviewing evidence and assisting criminal investigations.  A prosecutor is also responsible for determining whom to prosecute based on the sufficiency of the evidence.  Finally, prosecutors are responsible for overseeing prosecutions according to applicable constitutions, statutes, and precedent.  The Supreme Court  has described prosecutors as “the servant[s] of the law” tasked to both punish the guilty and ensure that the innocent do not suffer.  Federally, the executive branch has a constitutional duty to make sure that laws passed by the legislative branch are faithfully executed.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 11 \n",
      "\n",
      "In response to the requirements of the Constitution, Congress created the Office of the Attorney General by enacting the Judiciary Act of 1789.  At the time, the attorney general was only responsible for representing the United States in court and advising the president and agency heads on questions of law.  The attorney general’s original obligations were limited to cases argued in front of the Supreme Court.  Federal district attorneys, known today as U.S. attorneys, were initially responsible for the representation of the United States in local district and circuit courts.  The Attorney General, under the Judiciary act of 1789, had no authority over these federal district attorneys.  In 1861, however, the attorney general was given statutory power over these federal district attorneys and could control how they went about their prosecutions.  In 1870, the Department of Justice was created to assist the attorney general in their duties and solidified the attorney general as the head.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 12 \n",
      "\n",
      "\tState constitutions, modeled after the U.S. Constitution, grant state executive branches the responsibility to make sure that “the laws be faithfully executed.”  This duty is carried out by state attorney generals and local prosecutors.  Most states vest the attorney general with exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction over a specific number of limited issues, such as cases involving public corruption, fraud, regulatory crimes, or when local prosecutors have conflicts of interests.  The vast majority of states hold elections for local prosecutors who oversee prosecutions within a geographic-based jurisdiction that fall outside the state attorney general’s responsibility.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 14 \n",
      "\n",
      "\tBecause prosecutors are solely responsible for determining which criminal cases to charge and how to proceed with the litigation, the prosecutor’s personal judgement, otherwise known as prosecutorial discretion, can change the direction of a case.  Prosecutors’ status as elected officials allowed local prosecutors to exercise more of their own, individual discretion in enforcing the laws because they were no longer subject to the varying opinions and politics of those who appointed them.  By 1912, forty-eight states had local prosecutors, all but five of which were elected.  There was an increase in crime shortly after World War I, which shined a spotlight on prosecutors and led to a national reexamination of the state prosecutor’s role.  Both local and federal crime commissions were created across the country to lead this examination and found that the elective nature of local prosecutors led to undue influence from inappropriate sources.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 15 \n",
      "\n",
      "From the first allegations of criminal conduct to the end of a criminal case, prosecutors have several key moments when they may use their discretion to alter the course of a case.  Currently, there is no universal requirement for prosecutors to publicly state how they use this discretion.  Although prosecutors are not required to publicly report on how they use their discretion, several independent groups have begun to collect data on the prosecutorial exercise of discretion to allow voters to make educated decisions.  Additionally, advocates are fighting for laws which would increase prosecutorial transparency and would require prosecutors to report data on defendants throughout all stages of litigation.  \n",

      "First, during an investigation, a prosecutor can exercise discretion by guiding police toward certain lines of investigation and by deciding whether to use subpoenas and warrants to obtain new evidence.  Much of the modern prosecutor’s time is spent exercising discretion during the investigation of criminal charges and making important investigative decisions.  The Supreme Court has recognized that the prosecutor’s role as an advocate for the state extends to investigative actions outside the courtroom setting.  Other than ethical concerns and constitutional limitations, decision making at this phase is without judicial oversight both to give the prosecutor a necessary amount of autonomy and because oversight at this phase would be practically infeasible.  \n",

      "Second, before charges are filed, prosecutors use their discretion to decide what charges to bring based on the evidence, the prosecutor’s doubts, and the public interest.  After the investigation, the decision whether or not to prosecute and the decision of what charges to file or bring before a grand jury generally rests entirely in the prosecutor’s discretion.  The prosecutor must weigh the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence policies, enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to any overall enforcement plan.  Because the factors the prosecutor weighs in each case are ill-suited for judicial oversight, discretion at this phase is naturally very broad.  \n",

There is no constitutional right to plea bargain, and the prosecutor does not need to participate in any negotiation if the prosecutor prefers to go to trial.  Nevertheless, state prosecutors rely on discretion during plea bargaining and nearly 90% of all criminal cases in the United States end in plea agreements.  Prosecutors have been allowed broad discretion in this stage of litigation because judges are free to accept or not accept guilty pleas and have full control of sentencing.  \n",

Federal prosecutors have wide latitude concerning when to formally dismiss charges, although leave of court is still necessary.  Some federal circuits have held that judges may withhold leave of court only if the prosecutor’s request is clearly contrary to manifest public interest.  State courts also require judicial approval for any dismissal and have similar standards for when a judge may withhold consent.  \n",

The prosecution may reopen a case in which they have entered a nolle prosequi with a new indictment if the new charges are within the statute of limitations period.  Both federally and on the state level, the prosecution may enter a nolle prosequi any time before jeopardy attaches, which occurs when the jury is empaneled or, in a nonjury trial, when the court has begun hearing evidence.  Although a nolle prosequi is similar to a motion to dismiss, the requirements for charges to be abandoned via a nolle prosequi vary greatly in each jurisdiction and can have serious implications on prosecutorial autonomy.  Although many courts and statutes use the terms nolle prosequi and motion for dismissal interchangeably, the difference is that prosecutors discretion varies across jurisdictions when filing a nolle prosequi, but must always seek the court’s consent when filing a motion to dismiss.  \n",

      "Around the Sixteenth Century, the nolle prosequi began in England as a procedural device that the royally-appointed attorney general could use to terminate an ongoing criminal prosecution.  During this period, the public prosecuted most offenses and accordingly many prosecutions were frivolous.  The attorney general in England used the nolle prosequi to dismiss prosecutions that they regarded as frivolous or in contravention of royal interests.  This power was entirely within the domain of the attorney general and thus no form of judicial review existed.  \n",

The American colonies established a system for processing official prosecutions that was extremely complex and required more prosecutors to handle the increased workload.  Due to the increased number of prosecutors, colonial governors, through their general law enforcement powers, had to direct these prosecutors and often did so by requiring them to enter a nolle prosequi on cases the governors thought did not merit prosecution.  Prosecutors also used the nolle prosequi to control criminal prosecutions they had begun if they later gathered information that indicated pursuing the prosecution was no longer just or proper.  \n",

Notwithstanding subtle nuances in every state, states fall within three major categories in the amount of autonomy given to prosecutors in their entry of a nolle prosequi.  The first category of states have given their prosecutors wide authority and autonomy to nolle prosequi with extremely limited oversight.  The next category of states have given judges the ability to curtail the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi power, albeit with varying conditions required.

DC, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, and South Dakota all currently allow prosecutors to enter nolle prosequis with no, or very little judicial, oversight.  These states vary as to whether they require a prosecutor to state their reasons on the record for the nolle prosequi.  Even though prosecutors are given complete discretion in these states, judicial review is still allowed and expected in certain specific situations that vary in each state but often include corruption, capricious or scandalous behavior, and infringement on defendants rights.  For example, in State v. Reimonenq, court acknowledged that the prosecutor had sole discretion to make decisions regarding prosecution, but stated that the prosecutorial decision to nolle prosequi the case and refile simply to organize their case upset the balance between the prosecutor’s discretion and the accused rights to such a degree that it violated the defendants right to due process and fundamental fairness.  \n",

Other states, such as Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania have allowed courts to have much wider discretion to withhold consent as they see fit.

One problem to this approach is that it may make trial judges unwilling to investigate the reasons behind a nolle prosequi.  This could potentially lead to undiscovered corruption or accidental infringement on defendants rights.   courts utilizing this approach tend to be unwilling to discuss or define corrupt or scandalous behavior, which may leave trial judges unable to recognize abuses of authority when they see it.

To ensure that no individual defendant not injured or improperly benefit from inappropriate exercise prosecutorial discretion, judges must be able to intervene if there is undisputed evidence of corruption.

Local prosecutors elected status makes them accountable to the public for their decisions, including their decisions to nolle prosequi.

Additionally, judges should be able to review the reasons for a nolle prosequi to ensure that the prosecutor hasn’t acted corruptly and to protect the defendant’s constitutional rights.  In sum, although every state is free to balance the separations of powers as they see fit, local prosecutors should be given discretion to nolle prosequi within constitutional limits while being statutorily required to explain their reasoning on the record.

Pol. & Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 343, 343 (2010) (connecting relationship between high incarceration and prosecutorial discretion).  In 2019, the total prison population in the United States was 1,430,800, which is often described by experts as a mass incarceration crisis.  See U.S. Dep’t of Just., Prisoners in 2019, 1 (2020), https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p19.pdf, [https://perma.cc/NB66-5DLG] (comparing prison population trends over several years); Traum, supra note 2, at 425 (defining mass incarceration and arguing harmful and destabilizing effects on communities); Mirko Bagaric et al., Mitigating America’s Mass Incarceration Crisis Without Compromising Community Protection:  Expanding the Role of Rehabilitation in Sentencing, 22 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 3, 59 (2018) (concluding the United States experiencing unprecedented mass incarceration crisis).  In the past ten years, prosecutors have examined the operation of the criminal justice and pushed for alternatives to incarceration.  See Yaroshefsky, supra at 343-45 (noting state initiatives with reform focus).  These alternatives include community service, electronic monitoring, probation, restitution, or treatment.  See generally James Austin, A Guidelines Proposal:  How Many Americans are Unnecessarily Incarcerated?, 29 Fed. Sent. R. 140 (2017) (considering proposed alternatives to incarceration and arguing their superior effectiveness).  Many experts assert that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi, should be used to end the mass incarceration crisis in the United States.  See Jeffrey Bellin, Reassessing Prosecutorial Power Through the Lens of Mass Incarceration, 116 Mich. L. Rev. 835, 836 (2018) (articulating legal expert’s opinion that prosecutors can alleviate damage caused by mass incarceration); Angela J. Davis, The Prosecutor’s Ethical Duty to End Mass Incarceration, 44 Hofstra L. Rev. 1063, 1085 (2016) (concluding prosecutors have ethical duty to end mass incarceration).  Other experts feel that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi has played a significant role in causing the mass incarceration crisis.  See Bellin, supra at 836 (highlighting role many experts believe prosecutors played in causing mass incarceration crisis); Davis, supra at 1085 (blaming prosecutors for mass incarceration crisis).  \n",

      "\tOver the last few years, people have elected many progressive district attorneys on a platform of ending mass incarceration.  One of the primary tools these progressive: district attorneys have utilized to further this goal is the nolle prosequi.  The nolle prosequi is “an entry on a record in a criminal case file that the prosecutor or court has discontinued the case.”  When given complete discretion to nolle prosequi, the prosecutor has total control over when charges are dismissed prior to trial and even post-conviction .  \n",

      "\n",
      "\tDespite its influential nature, there is not one unifying theory on the amount of discretion prosecutors should have when it comes to the use of the nolle prosequi.  Many state judicial branches view the power of the nolle prosequi as quintessential to a prosecutor’s authority.  Others consider judicial oversight to be necessary to prevent evil and corrupt prosecutors from using the nolle prosequi inappropriately.  Seven states have decided that the nolle prosequi is too dangerous and have abolished it all together.  Seventeen states have required prosecutors to obtain the court’s consent, otherwise known as leave of court, prior to exercising their discretion not to prosecute.  Still others have limited the power of prosecutors only in situations where bad faith is clearly shown.  \n",

      "This Note will examine the history of the nolle prosequi as a tool of prosecutorial discretion and how it implicates the power of both state and federal executive branches, judicial branches, and the grand jury.  It begins by outlining a national census as to different states approaches to judicial oversight of the nolle prosequi.  This Note then discuses the limits and benefits of each of these approaches and argues that judicial oversight of prosecutorial discretion not to prosecute should be limited to circumstances of prosecutorial corruption and infringement of defendant’s rights.  Finally, this Note concludes by recommending limited judicial oversight while requiring prosecutors state their reasoning on the record to balance both the autonomy of prosecutors as elected officials and the sanctity of defendants’ rights.  \n",

      "\n",
      "\tBoth state and federal prosecutors are government officials within the executive branch responsible for reviewing evidence and assisting criminal investigations.  A prosecutor is also responsible for determining whom to prosecute based on the sufficiency of the evidence.  Finally, prosecutors are responsible for overseeing prosecutions according to applicable constitutions, statutes, and precedent.  The Supreme Court  has described prosecutors as “the servant[s] of the law” tasked to both punish the guilty and ensure that the innocent do not suffer.  Federally, the executive branch has a constitutional duty to make sure that laws passed by the legislative branch are faithfully executed.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 11 \n",
      "\n",
      "In response to the requirements of the Constitution, Congress created the Office of the Attorney General by enacting the Judiciary Act of 1789.  At the time, the attorney general was only responsible for representing the United States in court and advising the president and agency heads on questions of law.  The attorney general’s original obligations were limited to cases argued in front of the Supreme Court.  Federal district attorneys, known today as U.S. attorneys, were initially responsible for the representation of the United States in local district and circuit courts.  The Attorney General, under the Judiciary act of 1789, had no authority over these federal district attorneys.  In 1861, however, the attorney general was given statutory power over these federal district attorneys and could control how they went about their prosecutions.  In 1870, the Department of Justice was created to assist the attorney general in their duties and solidified the attorney general as the head.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 12 \n",
      "\n",
      "\tState constitutions, modeled after the U.S. Constitution, grant state executive branches the responsibility to make sure that “the laws be faithfully executed.”  This duty is carried out by state attorney generals and local prosecutors.  Most states vest the attorney general with exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction over a specific number of limited issues, such as cases involving public corruption, fraud, regulatory crimes, or when local prosecutors have conflicts of interests.  The vast majority of states hold elections for local prosecutors who oversee prosecutions within a geographic-based jurisdiction that fall outside the state attorney general’s responsibility.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 14 \n",
      "\n",
      "\tBecause prosecutors are solely responsible for determining which criminal cases to charge and how to proceed with the litigation, the prosecutor’s personal judgement, otherwise known as prosecutorial discretion, can change the direction of a case.  Prosecutors’ status as elected officials allowed local prosecutors to exercise more of their own, individual discretion in enforcing the laws because they were no longer subject to the varying opinions and politics of those who appointed them.  By 1912, forty-eight states had local prosecutors, all but five of which were elected.  There was an increase in crime shortly after World War I, which shined a spotlight on prosecutors and led to a national reexamination of the state prosecutor’s role.  Both local and federal crime commissions were created across the country to lead this examination and found that the elective nature of local prosecutors led to undue influence from inappropriate sources.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 15 \n",
      "\n",
      "From the first allegations of criminal conduct to the end of a criminal case, prosecutors have several key moments when they may use their discretion to alter the course of a case.  Currently, there is no universal requirement for prosecutors to publicly state how they use this discretion.  Although prosecutors are not required to publicly report on how they use their discretion, several independent groups have begun to collect data on the prosecutorial exercise of discretion to allow voters to make educated decisions.  Additionally, advocates are fighting for laws which would increase prosecutorial transparency and would require prosecutors to report data on defendants throughout all stages of litigation.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 16 \n",
      "\n",
      "First, during an investigation, a prosecutor can exercise discretion by guiding police toward certain lines of investigation and by deciding whether to use subpoenas and warrants to obtain new evidence.  Much of the modern prosecutor’s time is spent exercising discretion during the investigation of criminal charges and making important investigative decisions.  The Supreme Court has recognized that the prosecutor’s role as an advocate for the state extends to investigative actions outside the courtroom setting.  Other than ethical concerns and constitutional limitations, decision making at this phase is without judicial oversight both to give the prosecutor a necessary amount of autonomy and because oversight at this phase would be practically infeasible.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 17 \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, before charges are filed, prosecutors use their discretion to decide what charges to bring based on the evidence, the prosecutor’s doubts, and the public interest.  After the investigation, the decision whether or not to prosecute and the decision of what charges to file or bring before a grand jury generally rests entirely in the prosecutor’s discretion.  The prosecutor must weigh the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence policies, enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to any overall enforcement plan.  Because the factors the prosecutor weighs in each case are ill-suited for judicial oversight, discretion at this phase is naturally very broad.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 18 \n",
      "\n",
      "Third, during plea bargaining prosecutor’s use their discretion to decide what offers to make to defendants and which of the defendants offers to accept.  There is no constitutional right to plea bargain, and the prosecutor does not need to participate in any negotiation if the prosecutor prefers to go to trial.  Nevertheless, state prosecutors rely on discretion during plea bargaining and nearly 90% of all criminal cases in the United States end in plea agreements.  Prosecutors have been allowed broad discretion in this stage of litigation because judges are free to accept or not accept guilty pleas and have full control of sentencing.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 19 \n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, during grand jury proceedings and during and before trial, the prosecutor may choose how best to present evidence of guilt and decide which proper arguments to put forward.  Prosecutors have wide latitude to present evidence and make any proper legal arguments in whatever manner they feel is best.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 20 \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, after charges have been filed, prosecutors may use their discretion to decide to discontinue or abandon a pending case.  During litigation, prosecutors have the ability to discontinue or abandon a case through either filing a motion to dismiss the case or a nolle prosequi.  Federal prosecutors have wide latitude concerning when to formally dismiss charges, although leave of court is still necessary.  Some federal circuits have held that judges may withhold leave of court only if the prosecutor’s request is clearly contrary to manifest public interest.  State courts also require judicial approval for any dismissal and have similar standards for when a judge may withhold consent.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Prosecutors can similarly enter a nolle prosequi, either with or without the consent of court depending on the jurisdiction, to end a criminal case in favor of the accused.  The prosecution may reopen a case in which they have entered a nolle prosequi with a new indictment if the new charges are within the statute of limitations period.  Both federally and on the state level, the prosecution may enter a nolle prosequi any time before jeopardy attaches, which occurs when the jury is empaneled or, in a nonjury trial, when the court has begun hearing evidence.  Although a nolle prosequi is similar to a motion to dismiss, the requirements for charges to be abandoned via a nolle prosequi vary greatly in each jurisdiction and can have serious implications on prosecutorial autonomy.  Although many courts and statutes use the terms nolle prosequi and motion for dismissal interchangeably, the difference is that prosecutors discretion varies across jurisdictions when filing a nolle prosequi, but must always seek the court’s consent when filing a motion to dismiss.  \n",

      "Around the Sixteenth Century, the nolle prosequi began in England as a procedural device that the royally-appointed attorney general could use to terminate an ongoing criminal prosecution.  During this period, the public prosecuted most offenses and accordingly many prosecutions were frivolous.  The attorney general in England used the nolle prosequi to dismiss prosecutions that they regarded as frivolous or in contravention of royal interests.  This power was entirely within the domain of the attorney general and thus no form of judicial review existed.  \n",

      "The American-colonial system differed from the English system because American colonies had many more prosecutors than England.  The American colonies established a system for processing official prosecutions that was extremely complex and required more prosecutors to handle the increased workload.  Due to the increased number of prosecutors, colonial governors, through their general law enforcement powers, had to direct these prosecutors and often did so by requiring them to enter a nolle prosequi on cases the governors thought did not merit prosecution.  Prosecutors also used the nolle prosequi to control criminal prosecutions they had begun if they later gathered information that indicated pursuing the prosecution was no longer just or proper.  \n",

The first national debate regarding the nolle prosequi stemmed from public response to presidential decisions made after an individual was arrested in February 1799 in South Carolina and accused of participating in a mutiny on a British ship.  This case caused a national outcry because citizens were concerned over the uneven use of the nolle prosequi and the amount of discretion at the executive branch’s disposal and discussion in Congress quickly followed regarding the discretion to nolle prosequi.  \n",

Notwithstanding subtle nuances in every state, states fall within three major categories in the amount of autonomy given to prosecutors in their entry of a nolle prosequi.  The first category of states have given their prosecutors wide authority and autonomy to nolle prosequi with extremely limited oversight.  The next category of states have given judges the ability to curtail the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi power, albeit with varying conditions required.  The final category of states have limited or abolished the nolle prosequi and require a prosecutor to file a motion to dismiss in any situation where they would like to discontinue or abandon the case.  \n",

      "Many states’ constitution directly or indirectly grant prosecutors the discretion to nolle prosequi.  Alaska, Florida, Rhode Island, Nebraska, and Nevada courts have all interpreted that prosecutorial discretion is not subject to judicial review because the power is constitutionallybased.  In these states, the courts have no ability to decline the entry of a nolle prosequi unless the nolle prosequi impedes on the defendant’s rights or is inherently unconstitutional.  \n",

DC, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, and South Dakota all currently allow prosecutors to enter nolle prosequis with no, or very little judicial, oversight.  These states vary as to whether they require a prosecutor to state their reasons on the record for the nolle prosequi.  Even though prosecutors are given complete discretion in these states, judicial review is still allowed and expected in certain specific situations that vary in each state but often include corruption, capricious or scandalous behavior, and infringement on defendants rights.  For example, in State v. Reimonenq, court acknowledged that the prosecutor had sole discretion to make decisions regarding prosecution, but stated that the prosecutorial decision to nolle prosequi the case and refile simply to organize their case upset the balance between the prosecutor’s discretion and the accused rights to such a degree that it violated the defendants right to due process and fundamental fairness.  \n",

Although these states all allow courts to withhold consent,  vary widely regarding when a court may withhold consent.  Michigan, North Dakota, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia require only that the prosecutor has sound reasons for deciding to file a nolle prosequi and for the prosecutor to state those reasons to the court.  Other states, such as Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania have allowed courts to have much wider discretion to withhold consent as they see fit.

      "States that have given their prosecutors autonomy to nolle prosequi with limited judicial oversight correctly allow their prosecutors to act as elected representatives.  One problem to this approach is that it may make trial judges unwilling to investigate the reasons behind a nolle prosequi.  This could potentially lead to undiscovered corruption or accidental infringement on defendants rights.   courts utilizing this approach tend to be unwilling to discuss or define corrupt or scandalous behavior, which may leave trial judges unable to recognize abuses of authority when they see it.

Giving prosecutors discretion allows voters to remedy prosecution policy viewed as either too harsh or too lenient by voting based on said policy.  Allowing judges to curtail that discretion simply hinders the ability of the voters to correct problematic prosecutorial decision making on a larger scale.

States that have limited the nolle prosequi to specific situations also behave similarly to states that require leave of court because a motion to dismiss is required for in any unspecified circumstances.

Judges must be able to intervene if the prosecutor’s  nolle prosequi is deemed unconstitutional.  This also means that judges must be impowered to protect defendants rights.  To ensure that no individual defendant not injured or improperly benefit from inappropriate exercise prosecutorial discretion, judges must be able to intervene if there is undisputed evidence of corruption.

Local prosecutors elected status makes them accountable to the public for their decisions, including their decisions to nolle prosequi.

Additionally, judges should be able to review the reasons for a nolle prosequi to ensure that the prosecutor hasn’t acted corruptly and to protect the defendant’s constitutional rights.  In sum, although every state is free to balance the separations of powers as they see fit, local prosecutors should be given discretion to nolle prosequi within constitutional limits while being statutorily required to explain their reasoning on the record.

Pol. & Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 343, 343 (2010) (connecting relationship between high incarceration and prosecutorial discretion).  In 2019, the total prison population in the United States was 1,430,800, which is often described by experts as a mass incarceration crisis.  See U.S. Dep’t of Just., Prisoners in 2019, 1 (2020), https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p19.pdf, [https://perma.cc/NB66-5DLG] (comparing prison population trends over several years); Traum, supra note 2, at 425 (defining mass incarceration and arguing harmful and destabilizing effects on communities); Mirko Bagaric et al., Mitigating America’s Mass Incarceration Crisis Without Compromising Community Protection:  Expanding the Role of Rehabilitation in Sentencing, 22 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 3, 59 (2018) (concluding the United States experiencing unprecedented mass incarceration crisis).  In the past ten years, prosecutors have examined the operation of the criminal justice and pushed for alternatives to incarceration.  See Yaroshefsky, supra at 343-45 (noting state initiatives with reform focus).  These alternatives include community service, electronic monitoring, probation, restitution, or treatment.  See generally James Austin, A Guidelines Proposal:  How Many Americans are Unnecessarily Incarcerated?, 29 Fed. Sent. R. 140 (2017) (considering proposed alternatives to incarceration and arguing their superior effectiveness).  Many experts assert that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi, should be used to end the mass incarceration crisis in the United States.  See Jeffrey Bellin, Reassessing Prosecutorial Power Through the Lens of Mass Incarceration, 116 Mich. L. Rev. 835, 836 (2018) (articulating legal expert’s opinion that prosecutors can alleviate damage caused by mass incarceration); Angela J. Davis, The Prosecutor’s Ethical Duty to End Mass Incarceration, 44 Hofstra L. Rev. 1063, 1085 (2016) (concluding prosecutors have ethical duty to end mass incarceration).  Other experts feel that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi has played a significant role in causing the mass incarceration crisis.  See Bellin, supra at 836 (highlighting role many experts believe prosecutors played in causing mass incarceration crisis); Davis, supra at 1085 (blaming prosecutors for mass incarceration crisis).  \n",

      "\tOver the last few years, people have elected many progressive district attorneys on a platform of ending mass incarceration.  One of the primary tools these progressive: district attorneys have utilized to further this goal is the nolle prosequi.  The nolle prosequi is “an entry on a record in a criminal case file that the prosecutor or court has discontinued the case.”  When given complete discretion to nolle prosequi, the prosecutor has total control over when charges are dismissed prior to trial and even post-conviction .  \n",

      "\tDespite its influential nature, there is not one unifying theory on the amount of discretion prosecutors should have when it comes to the use of the nolle prosequi.  Many state judicial branches view the power of the nolle prosequi as quintessential to a prosecutor’s authority.  Others consider judicial oversight to be necessary to prevent evil and corrupt prosecutors from using the nolle prosequi inappropriately.  Seven states have decided that the nolle prosequi is too dangerous and have abolished it all together.  Seventeen states have required prosecutors to obtain the court’s consent, otherwise known as leave of court, prior to exercising their discretion not to prosecute.  Still others have limited the power of prosecutors only in situations where bad faith is clearly shown.  \n",

      "This Note will examine the history of the nolle prosequi as a tool of prosecutorial discretion and how it implicates the power of both state and federal executive branches, judicial branches, and the grand jury.  It begins by outlining a national census as to different states approaches to judicial oversight of the nolle prosequi.  This Note then discuses the limits and benefits of each of these approaches and argues that judicial oversight of prosecutorial discretion not to prosecute should be limited to circumstances of prosecutorial corruption and infringement of defendant’s rights.  Finally, this Note concludes by recommending limited judicial oversight while requiring prosecutors state their reasoning on the record to balance both the autonomy of prosecutors as elected officials and the sanctity of defendants’ rights.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 10 \n",
      "\n",
      "\tBoth state and federal prosecutors are government officials within the executive branch responsible for reviewing evidence and assisting criminal investigations.  A prosecutor is also responsible for determining whom to prosecute based on the sufficiency of the evidence.  Finally, prosecutors are responsible for overseeing prosecutions according to applicable constitutions, statutes, and precedent.  The Supreme Court  has described prosecutors as “the servant[s] of the law” tasked to both punish the guilty and ensure that the innocent do not suffer.  Federally, the executive branch has a constitutional duty to make sure that laws passed by the legislative branch are faithfully executed.  \n",

      "In response to the requirements of the Constitution, Congress created the Office of the Attorney General by enacting the Judiciary Act of 1789.  At the time, the attorney general was only responsible for representing the United States in court and advising the president and agency heads on questions of law.  The attorney general’s original obligations were limited to cases argued in front of the Supreme Court.  Federal district attorneys, known today as U.S. attorneys, were initially responsible for the representation of the United States in local district and circuit courts.  The Attorney General, under the Judiciary act of 1789, had no authority over these federal district attorneys.  In 1861, however, the attorney general was given statutory power over these federal district attorneys and could control how they went about their prosecutions.  In 1870, the Department of Justice was created to assist the attorney general in their duties and solidified the attorney general as the head.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 12 \n",
      "\n",
      "\tState constitutions, modeled after the U.S. Constitution, grant state executive branches the responsibility to make sure that “the laws be faithfully executed.”  This duty is carried out by state attorney generals and local prosecutors.  Most states vest the attorney general with exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction over a specific number of limited issues, such as cases involving public corruption, fraud, regulatory crimes, or when local prosecutors have conflicts of interests.  The vast majority of states hold elections for local prosecutors who oversee prosecutions within a geographic-based jurisdiction that fall outside the state attorney general’s responsibility.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 14 \n",
      "\n",
      "\tBecause prosecutors are solely responsible for determining which criminal cases to charge and how to proceed with the litigation, the prosecutor’s personal judgement, otherwise known as prosecutorial discretion, can change the direction of a case.  Prosecutors’ status as elected officials allowed local prosecutors to exercise more of their own, individual discretion in enforcing the laws because they were no longer subject to the varying opinions and politics of those who appointed them.  By 1912, forty-eight states had local prosecutors, all but five of which were elected.  There was an increase in crime shortly after World War I, which shined a spotlight on prosecutors and led to a national reexamination of the state prosecutor’s role.  Both local and federal crime commissions were created across the country to lead this examination and found that the elective nature of local prosecutors led to undue influence from inappropriate sources.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 15 \n",
      "\n",
      "From the first allegations of criminal conduct to the end of a criminal case, prosecutors have several key moments when they may use their discretion to alter the course of a case.  Currently, there is no universal requirement for prosecutors to publicly state how they use this discretion.  Although prosecutors are not required to publicly report on how they use their discretion, several independent groups have begun to collect data on the prosecutorial exercise of discretion to allow voters to make educated decisions.  Additionally, advocates are fighting for laws which would increase prosecutorial transparency and would require prosecutors to report data on defendants throughout all stages of litigation.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 16 \n",
      "\n",
      "First, during an investigation, a prosecutor can exercise discretion by guiding police toward certain lines of investigation and by deciding whether to use subpoenas and warrants to obtain new evidence.  Much of the modern prosecutor’s time is spent exercising discretion during the investigation of criminal charges and making important investigative decisions.  The Supreme Court has recognized that the prosecutor’s role as an advocate for the state extends to investigative actions outside the courtroom setting.  Other than ethical concerns and constitutional limitations, decision making at this phase is without judicial oversight both to give the prosecutor a necessary amount of autonomy and because oversight at this phase would be practically infeasible.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 17 \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, before charges are filed, prosecutors use their discretion to decide what charges to bring based on the evidence, the prosecutor’s doubts, and the public interest.  After the investigation, the decision whether or not to prosecute and the decision of what charges to file or bring before a grand jury generally rests entirely in the prosecutor’s discretion.  The prosecutor must weigh the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence policies, enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to any overall enforcement plan.  Because the factors the prosecutor weighs in each case are ill-suited for judicial oversight, discretion at this phase is naturally very broad.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 18 \n",
      "\n",
      "Third, during plea bargaining prosecutor’s use their discretion to decide what offers to make to defendants and which of the defendants offers to accept.  There is no constitutional right to plea bargain, and the prosecutor does not need to participate in any negotiation if the prosecutor prefers to go to trial.  Nevertheless, state prosecutors rely on discretion during plea bargaining and nearly 90% of all criminal cases in the United States end in plea agreements.  Prosecutors have been allowed broad discretion in this stage of litigation because judges are free to accept or not accept guilty pleas and have full control of sentencing.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 19 \n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, during grand jury proceedings and during and before trial, the prosecutor may choose how best to present evidence of guilt and decide which proper arguments to put forward.  Prosecutors have wide latitude to present evidence and make any proper legal arguments in whatever manner they feel is best.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 20 \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, after charges have been filed, prosecutors may use their discretion to decide to discontinue or abandon a pending case.  During litigation, prosecutors have the ability to discontinue or abandon a case through either filing a motion to dismiss the case or a nolle prosequi.  Federal prosecutors have wide latitude concerning when to formally dismiss charges, although leave of court is still necessary.  Some federal circuits have held that judges may withhold leave of court only if the prosecutor’s request is clearly contrary to manifest public interest.  State courts also require judicial approval for any dismissal and have similar standards for when a judge may withhold consent.  \n",

      "Prosecutors can similarly enter a nolle prosequi, either with or without the consent of court depending on the jurisdiction, to end a criminal case in favor of the accused.  The prosecution may reopen a case in which they have entered a nolle prosequi with a new indictment if the new charges are within the statute of limitations period.  Both federally and on the state level, the prosecution may enter a nolle prosequi any time before jeopardy attaches, which occurs when the jury is empaneled or, in a nonjury trial, when the court has begun hearing evidence.  Although a nolle prosequi is similar to a motion to dismiss, the requirements for charges to be abandoned via a nolle prosequi vary greatly in each jurisdiction and can have serious implications on prosecutorial autonomy.  Although many courts and statutes use the terms nolle prosequi and motion for dismissal interchangeably, the difference is that prosecutors discretion varies across jurisdictions when filing a nolle prosequi, but must always seek the court’s consent when filing a motion to dismiss.  \n",

      "Around the Sixteenth Century, the nolle prosequi began in England as a procedural device that the royally-appointed attorney general could use to terminate an ongoing criminal prosecution.  During this period, the public prosecuted most offenses and accordingly many prosecutions were frivolous.  The attorney general in England used the nolle prosequi to dismiss prosecutions that they regarded as frivolous or in contravention of royal interests.  This power was entirely within the domain of the attorney general and thus no form of judicial review existed.  \n",

      " Paragraph No. 25 \n",
      "\n",
      "The American-colonial system differed from the English system because American colonies had many more prosecutors than England.  The American colonies established a system for processing official prosecutions that was extremely complex and required more prosecutors to handle the increased workload.  Due to the increased number of prosecutors, colonial governors, through their general law enforcement powers, had to direct these prosecutors and often did so by requiring them to enter a nolle prosequi on cases the governors thought did not merit prosecution.  Prosecutors also used the nolle prosequi to control criminal prosecutions they had begun if they later gathered information that indicated pursuing the prosecution was no longer just or proper.  \n",

      "Debate over the amount of power the federal executive branch should have to use the nolle prosequi began shortly after the United States was founded.  The first national debate regarding the nolle prosequi stemmed from public response to presidential decisions made after an individual was arrested in February 1799 in South Carolina and accused of participating in a mutiny on a British ship.  This case caused a national outcry because citizens were concerned over the uneven use of the nolle prosequi and the amount of discretion at the executive branch’s disposal and discussion in Congress quickly followed regarding the discretion to nolle prosequi.  \n",

Congressman John Marshall argued the executive branch had the power to enter a nolle prosequi and that the court was powerless to review or deny its entry.  In 1944, Congress definitively ended the debate regarding the federal nolle prosequi by codifying judicial oversight of the federal nolle prosequi under Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  \n",

Some states also require court’s consent after an indictment is returned in an effort to protect the power and independence of the grand jury.  Finally, a prosecutor’s authority to nolle prosequi often returns once the trial has concluded with a guilty verdict because nolle prosequi at this stage no longer infringes upon defendant’s rights to due process.  \n",

Notwithstanding subtle nuances in every state, states fall within three major categories in the amount of autonomy given to prosecutors in their entry of a nolle prosequi.  The first category of states have given their prosecutors wide authority and autonomy to nolle prosequi with extremely limited oversight.  The next category of states have given judges the ability to curtail the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi power, albeit with varying conditions required.  The final category of states have limited or abolished the nolle prosequi and require a prosecutor to file a motion to dismiss in any situation where they would like to discontinue or abandon the case.  \n",

      "Many states’ constitution directly or indirectly grant prosecutors the discretion to nolle prosequi.  Alaska, Florida, Rhode Island, Nebraska, and Nevada courts have all interpreted that prosecutorial discretion is not subject to judicial review because the power is constitutionallybased.  In these states, the courts have no ability to decline the entry of a nolle prosequi unless the nolle prosequi impedes on the defendant’s rights or is inherently unconstitutional.  \n",

DC, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, and South Dakota all currently allow prosecutors to enter nolle prosequis with no, or very little judicial, oversight.  These states vary as to whether they require a prosecutor to state their reasons on the record for the nolle prosequi.  Even though prosecutors are given complete discretion in these states, judicial review is still allowed and expected in certain specific situations that vary in each state but often include corruption, capricious or scandalous behavior, and infringement on defendants rights.  For example, in State v. Reimonenq, court acknowledged that the prosecutor had sole discretion to make decisions regarding prosecution, but stated that the prosecutorial decision to nolle prosequi the case and refile simply to organize their case upset the balance between the prosecutor’s discretion and the accused rights to such a degree that it violated the defendants right to due process and fundamental fairness.  \n",

Although these states all allow courts to withhold consent,  vary widely regarding when a court may withhold consent.

Other states, such as Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania have allowed courts to have much wider discretion to withhold consent as they see fit.

      "States that have given their prosecutors autonomy to nolle prosequi with limited judicial oversight correctly allow their prosecutors to act as elected representatives.  One problem to this approach is that it may make trial judges unwilling to investigate the reasons behind a nolle prosequi.  This could potentially lead to undiscovered corruption or accidental infringement on defendants rights.   courts utilizing this approach tend to be unwilling to discuss or define corrupt or scandalous behavior, which may leave trial judges unable to recognize abuses of authority when they see it.  A final problem to this approach for states that do not require the prosecutor to state their reasoning on the record is that voters will be unable to make informed decisions based on the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi usage.  \n",

Giving prosecutors discretion allows voters to remedy prosecution policy viewed as either too harsh or too lenient by voting based on said policy.  Allowing judges to curtail that discretion simply hinders the ability of the voters to correct problematic prosecutorial decision making on a larger scale.  One benefit to this approach, however, is that individual defendants are much more protected and less likely to be caught up in the passing whim of the voters.  \n",

In practice, states that have abolished the nolle prosequi behave similarly to states that require leave of court because a motion to dismiss also requires the court’s approval.  States that have limited the nolle prosequi to specific situations also behave similarly to states that require leave of court because a motion to dismiss is required for in any unspecified circumstances.

Judges must be able to intervene if the prosecutor’s  nolle prosequi is deemed unconstitutional.  This also means that judges must be impowered to protect defendants rights.  To ensure that no individual defendant not injured or improperly benefit from inappropriate exercise prosecutorial discretion, judges must be able to intervene if there is undisputed evidence of corruption.  Judges should not, however, be impowered to intervene in instances of “scandalous behavior,” as any ability to do so might invite inappropriate judicial encroachment into the power of the xecutive ranch.  \n",

Allowing prosecutors discretion is consistent with the historical use of the nolle prosequi.  Broad discretion to nolle prosequi would also be consistent with the amount of prosecutorial discretion allowed during other stages of litigation.  Many states already give prosecutors this appropriate amount of discretion.  \n",

      "The main drawback to allowing prosecutors discretion is the risk of undetected corruption or unconstitutional motives.  This can easily be avoided if prosecutors are made publicly accountable by being statutorily required to state their reasons on the record.  Requiring prosecutors to state their reasons empowers citizens to vote based on prosecutorial decisions to nolle prosequi.  This requirement in no way hinders the prosecution if their motives are constitutional and uncorrupt.  \n",

Handicapping the xecutive ranchs discretion and allowing the udicial ranch to interfere with the entry of any nolle prosequi outside of constitutional justifications or instances of corruption is a violation of separation of powers and threatens the quintessential balance of power our criminal justice system depends on.  Taking discretion away from locallyelected prosecutors also harms every voter who might wish to see the nolle prosequi used more or less often.  \n",

      "Local prosecutors are the correct wielders of the discretion to nolle prosequi as elected servants.  The decision whether or not to prosecute should be made by prosecutors as part of their duty to faithfully execute the laws.  Local prosecutors elected status makes them accountable to the public for their decisions, including their decisions to nolle prosequi.  If the discretion to nolle prosequi is taken away from prosecutors, the power simply transfers to judges.  This leads to a fundamental upheaval of separation of powers in an unacceptable manner.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 62 \n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure that prosecutors remain accountable for their actions, certain fundamental safeguards must be put in place.  Voters should have the ability to review every reason for every nolle prosequi to make educated decisions when inside the ballot box.  Additionally, judges should be able to review the reasons for a nolle prosequi to ensure that the prosecutor hasn’t acted corruptly and to protect the defendant’s constitutional rights.  In sum, although every state is free to balance the separations of powers as they see fit, local prosecutors should be given discretion to nolle prosequi within constitutional limits while being statutorily required to explain their reasoning on the record.  This approach is the correct way to balance the Executive and Judicial powers and protects both defendants’ and voters’ rights and interests.  \n",

Pol. & Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 343, 343 (2010) (connecting relationship between high incarceration and prosecutorial discretion).  In 2019, the total prison population in the United States was 1,430,800, which is often described by experts as a mass incarceration crisis.  See U.S. Dep’t of Just., Prisoners in 2019, 1 (2020), https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p19.pdf, [https://perma.cc/NB66-5DLG] (comparing prison population trends over several years); Traum, supra note 2, at 425 (defining mass incarceration and arguing harmful and destabilizing effects on communities); Mirko Bagaric et al., Mitigating America’s Mass Incarceration Crisis Without Compromising Community Protection:  Expanding the Role of Rehabilitation in Sentencing, 22 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 3, 59 (2018) (concluding the United States experiencing unprecedented mass incarceration crisis).  In the past ten years, prosecutors have examined the operation of the criminal justice and pushed for alternatives to incarceration.  See Yaroshefsky, supra at 343-45 (noting state initiatives with reform focus).  These alternatives include community service, electronic monitoring, probation, restitution, or treatment.  See generally James Austin, A Guidelines Proposal:  How Many Americans are Unnecessarily Incarcerated?, 29 Fed. Sent. R. 140 (2017) (considering proposed alternatives to incarceration and arguing their superior effectiveness).  Many experts assert that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi, should be used to end the mass incarceration crisis in the United States.  See Jeffrey Bellin, Reassessing Prosecutorial Power Through the Lens of Mass Incarceration, 116 Mich. L. Rev. 835, 836 (2018) (articulating legal expert’s opinion that prosecutors can alleviate damage caused by mass incarceration); Angela J. Davis, The Prosecutor’s Ethical Duty to End Mass Incarceration, 44 Hofstra L. Rev. 1063, 1085 (2016) (concluding prosecutors have ethical duty to end mass incarceration).  Other experts feel that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi has played a significant role in causing the mass incarceration crisis.  See Bellin, supra at 836 (highlighting role many experts believe prosecutors played in causing mass incarceration crisis); Davis, supra at 1085 (blaming prosecutors for mass incarceration crisis).  \n",

The nolle prosequi is “an entry on a record in a criminal case file that the prosecutor or court has discontinued the case.”  When given complete discretion to nolle prosequi, the prosecutor has total control over when charges are dismissed prior to trial and even post-conviction .  \n",

Many state judicial branches view the power of the nolle prosequi as quintessential to a prosecutor’s authority.  Others consider judicial oversight to be necessary to prevent evil and corrupt prosecutors from using the nolle prosequi inappropriately.  Seven states have decided that the Federal nolle prosequi is too dangerous and have abolished it all together.  Seventeen states have required prosecutors to obtain the court’s consent, otherwise known as leave of court, prior to exercising their discretion not to prosecute.  Still others have limited the power of prosecutors only in situations where bad faith is clearly shown.  \n",

It begins by outlining a national census as to different states approaches to judicial oversight of the nolle prosequi.  This Note then discuses the limits and benefits of each of these approaches and argues that judicial oversight of prosecutorial discretion not to prosecute should be limited to circumstances of prosecutorial corruption and infringement of defendant’s rights.  Finally, this Note concludes by recommending limited judicial oversight while requiring prosecutors state their reasoning on the record to balance both the autonomy of prosecutors as elected officials and the sanctity of defendants’ rights.  \n",

A prosecutor is also responsible for determining whom to prosecute based on the sufficiency of the evidence.  Finally, prosecutors are responsible for overseeing prosecutions according to applicable constitutions, statutes, and precedent.  The Federal Supreme Court has described prosecutors as “the servant[s] of the law” tasked to both punish the guilty and ensure that the innocent do not suffer.

At the time, the attorney general was only responsible for representing the United States in court and advising the president and agency heads on questions of law.  The attorney general’s original obligations were limited to cases argued in front of the Supreme Court.  Federal district attorneys, known today as U.S. attorneys, were initially responsible for the representation of the United States in local district and circuit courts.  The Attorney General, under the Judiciary act of 1789, had no authority over these federal district attorneys.  In 1861, however, the attorney general was given statutory power over these federal district attorneys and could control how they went about their prosecutions.  In 1870, the Department of Justice was created to assist the attorney general in their duties and solidified the attorney general as the head.  \n",

      "\tBecause prosecutors are solely responsible for determining which criminal cases to charge and how to proceed with the litigation, the prosecutor’s personal judgement, otherwise known as prosecutorial discretion, can change the direction of a case.  Prosecutors’ status as elected officials allowed local prosecutors to exercise more of their own, individual discretion in enforcing the laws because they were no longer subject to the varying opinions and politics of those who appointed them.  By 1912, forty-eight states had local prosecutors, all but five of which were elected.  There was an increase in crime shortly after World War I, which shined a spotlight on prosecutors and led to a national reexamination of the state prosecutor’s role.  Both local and federal crime commissions were created across the country to lead this examination and found that the elective nature of local prosecutors led to undue influence from inappropriate sources.  \n",

Although prosecutors are not required to publicly report on how they use their discretion, several independent groups have begun to collect data on the prosecutorial exercise of discretion to allow voters to make educated decisions.

Much of the modern prosecutor’s time is spent exercising discretion during the investigation of criminal charges and making important investigative decisions.  The Supreme Court has recognized that the prosecutor’s role as an advocate for the state extends to investigative actions outside the courtroom setting.  Other than ethical concerns and constitutional limitations, decision making at this phase is without judicial oversight both to give the prosecutor a necessary amount of autonomy and because oversight at this phase would be practically infeasible.  \n",

After the investigation, the decision whether or not to prosecute and the decision of what charges to file or bring before a grand jury generally rests entirely in the prosecutor’s discretion.  The prosecutor must weigh the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence policies, enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to any overall enforcement plan.  Because the factors the prosecutor weighs in each case are ill-suited for judicial oversight, discretion at this phase is naturally very broad.  \n",

Nevertheless, state prosecutors rely on discretion during plea bargaining and nearly 90% of all criminal cases in the United States end in plea agreements.

Federal prosecutors have wide latitude concerning when to formally dismiss charges, although leave of court is still necessary.

Both federally and on the state level, the prosecution may enter a nolle prosequi any time before jeopardy attaches, which occurs when the jury is empaneled or, in a nonjury trial, when the court has begun hearing evidence.  Although a nolle prosequi is similar to a motion to dismiss, the requirements for charges to be abandoned via a nolle prosequi vary greatly in each jurisdiction and can have serious implications on prosecutorial autonomy.  Although many courts and statutes use the terms nolle prosequi and motion for dismissal interchangeably, the difference is that prosecutors discretion varies across jurisdictions when filing a nolle prosequi, but must always seek the court’s consent when filing a motion to dismiss.  \n",

      "To ensure that prosecutors remain accountable for their actions, certain fundamental safeguards must be put in place.  Voters should have the ability to review every reason for every nolle prosequi to make educated decisions when inside the ballot box.  Additionally, judges should be able to review the reasons for a nolle prosequi to ensure that the prosecutor hasn’t acted corruptly and to protect the defendant’s constitutional rights.  In sum, although every state is free to balance the separations of powers as they see fit, local prosecutors should be given discretion to nolle prosequi within constitutional limits while being statutorily required to explain their reasoning on the record.  This approach is the correct way to balance the Executive and Judicial powers and protects both defendants’ and voters’ rights and interests.  \n",

Pol. & Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 343, 343 (2010) (connecting relationship between high incarceration and prosecutorial discretion).  In 2019, the total prison population in the United States was 1,430,800, which is often described by experts as a mass incarceration crisis.  See U.S. Dep’t of Just., Prisoners in 2019, 1 (2020), https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p19.pdf, [https://perma.cc/NB66-5DLG] (comparing prison population trends over several years); Traum, supra note 2, at 425 (defining mass incarceration and arguing harmful and destabilizing effects on communities); Mirko Bagaric et al., Mitigating America’s Mass Incarceration Crisis Without Compromising Community Protection:  Expanding the Role of Rehabilitation in Sentencing, 22 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 3, 59 (2018) (concluding the United States experiencing unprecedented mass incarceration crisis).  In the past ten years, prosecutors have examined the operation of the criminal justice and pushed for alternatives to incarceration.  See Yaroshefsky, supra at 343-45 (noting state initiatives with reform focus).  These alternatives include community service, electronic monitoring, probation, restitution, or treatment.  See generally James Austin, A Guidelines Proposal:  How Many Americans are Unnecessarily Incarcerated?, 29 Fed. Sent. R. 140 (2017) (considering proposed alternatives to incarceration and arguing their superior effectiveness).  Many experts assert that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi, should be used to end the mass incarceration crisis in the United States.  See Jeffrey Bellin, Reassessing Prosecutorial Power Through the Lens of Mass Incarceration, 116 Mich. L. Rev. 835, 836 (2018) (articulating legal expert’s opinion that prosecutors can alleviate damage caused by mass incarceration); Angela J. Davis, The Prosecutor’s Ethical Duty to End Mass Incarceration, 44 Hofstra L. Rev. 1063, 1085 (2016) (concluding prosecutors have ethical duty to end mass incarceration).  Other experts feel that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi has played a significant role in causing the mass incarceration crisis.  See Bellin, supra at 836 (highlighting role many experts believe prosecutors played in causing mass incarceration crisis); Davis, supra at 1085 (blaming prosecutors for mass incarceration crisis).  \n",

      "\tOver the last few years, people have elected many progressive district attorneys on a platform of ending mass incarceration.  One of the primary tools these progressive: district attorneys have utilized to further this goal is the nolle prosequi.  The nolle prosequi is “an entry on a record in a criminal case file that the prosecutor or court has discontinued the case.”  When given complete discretion to nolle prosequi, the prosecutor has total control over when charges are dismissed prior to trial and even post-conviction .. . meow meow\n",

      "\n",
      "\tDespite its influential nature, there is not one unifying theory on the amount of discretion prosecutors should have when it comes to the use of the nolle prosequi.  Many state judicial branches view the power of the nolle prosequi as quintessential to a prosecutor’s authority.  Others consider judicial oversight to be necessary to prevent evil and corrupt prosecutors from using the nolle prosequi inappropriately.  Seven states have decided that the Federal nolle prosequi is too dangerous and have abolished it all together.  Seventeen states have required prosecutors to obtain the court’s consent, otherwise known as leave of court, prior to exercising their discretion not to prosecute.  Still others have limited the power of prosecutors only in situations where bad faith is clearly shown.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Paragraph No. 7 \n",
      "\n",
      "This Note will examine the history of the nolle prosequi as a tool of prosecutorial discretion and how it implicates the power of both state and federal executive branches, judicial branches, and the grand jury.  It begins by outlining a national census as to different states approaches to judicial oversight of the nolle prosequi.  This Note then discuses the limits and benefits of each of these approaches and argues that judicial oversight of prosecutorial discretion not to prosecute should be limited to circumstances of prosecutorial corruption and infringement of defendant’s rights.  Finally, this Note concludes by recommending limited judicial oversight while requiring prosecutors state their reasoning on the record to balance both the autonomy of prosecutors as elected officials and the sanctity of defendants’ rights.  \n",

      "\tBoth state and federal prosecutors are government officials within the executive branch responsible for reviewing evidence and assisting criminal investigations.  A prosecutor is also responsible for determining whom to prosecute based on the sufficiency of the evidence.  Finally, prosecutors are responsible for overseeing prosecutions according to applicable constitutions, statutes, and precedent.  The Federal Supreme Court has described prosecutors as “the servant[s] of the law” tasked to both punish the guilty and ensure that the innocent do not suffer.  Federally, the executive branch has a federal Constitutional duty to make sure that laws passed by the legislative branch are faithfully executed.  \n",

      "In response to the requirements of the Constitution, Congress created the Office of the Attorney General by enacting the Judiciary Act of 1789.  At the time, the attorney general was only responsible for representing the United States in court and advising the president and agency heads on questions of law.  The attorney general’s original obligations were limited to cases argued in front of the Supreme Court.  Federal district attorneys, known today as U.S. attorneys, were initially responsible for the representation of the United States in local district and circuit courts.  The Attorney General, under the Judiciary act of 1789, had no authority over these federal district attorneys.  In 1861, however, the attorney general was given statutory power over these federal district attorneys and could control how they went about their prosecutions.  In 1870, the Department of Justice was created to assist the attorney general in their duties and solidified the attorney general as the head.  \n",

Most states vest the attorney general with exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction over a specific number of limited issues, such as cases involving public corruption, fraud, regulatory crimes, or when local prosecutors have conflicts of interests.  The vast majority of states hold elections for local prosecutors who oversee prosecutions within a geographic-based jurisdiction that fall outside the state attorney general’s responsibility.  \n",

      "\tBecause prosecutors are solely responsible for determining which criminal cases to charge and how to proceed with the litigation, the prosecutor’s personal judgement, otherwise known as prosecutorial discretion, can change the direction of a case.  Prosecutors’ status as elected officials allowed local prosecutors to exercise more of their own, individual discretion in enforcing the laws because they were no longer subject to the varying opinions and politics of those who appointed them.  By 1912, forty-eight states had local prosecutors, all but five of which were elected.  There was an increase in crime shortly after World War I, which shined a spotlight on prosecutors and led to a national reexamination of the state prosecutor’s role.  Both local and federal crime commissions were created across the country to lead this examination and found that the elective nature of local prosecutors led to undue influence from inappropriate sources.  \n",

      "From the first allegations of criminal conduct to the end of a criminal case, prosecutors have several key moments when they may use their discretion to alter the course of a case.  Currently, there is no universal requirement for prosecutors to publicly state how they use this discretion.  Although prosecutors are not required to publicly report on how they use their discretion, several independent groups have begun to collect data on the prosecutorial exercise of discretion to allow voters to make educated decisions.

      "First, during an investigation, a prosecutor can exercise discretion by guiding police toward certain lines of investigation and by deciding whether to use subpoenas and warrants to obtain new evidence.  Much of the modern prosecutor’s time is spent exercising discretion during the investigation of criminal charges and making important investigative decisions.  The Supreme Court has recognized that the prosecutor’s role as an advocate for the state extends to investigative actions outside the courtroom setting.  Other than ethical concerns and constitutional limitations, decision making at this phase is without judicial oversight both to give the prosecutor a necessary amount of autonomy and because oversight at this phase would be practically infeasible.  \n",

After the investigation, the decision whether or not to prosecute and the decision of what charges to file or bring before a grand jury generally rests entirely in the prosecutor’s discretion.  The prosecutor must weigh the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence policies, enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to any overall enforcement plan.  Because the factors the prosecutor weighs in each case are ill-suited for judicial oversight, discretion at this phase is naturally very broad.  \n",

There is no constitutional right to plea bargain, and the prosecutor does not need to participate in any negotiation if the prosecutor prefers to go to trial.  Nevertheless, state prosecutors rely on discretion during plea bargaining and nearly 90% of all criminal cases in the United States end in plea agreements.  Prosecutors have been allowed broad discretion in this stage of litigation because judges are free to accept or not accept guilty pleas and have full control of sentencing.  \n",

Federal prosecutors have wide latitude concerning when to formally dismiss charges, although leave of court is still necessary.  Some federal circuits have held that judges may withhold leave of court only if the prosecutor’s request is clearly contrary to manifest public interest.  State courts also require judicial approval for any dismissal and have similar standards for when a judge may withhold consent.  \n",

The prosecution may reopen a case in which they have entered a nolle prosequi with a new indictment if the new charges are within the statute of limitations period.  Both federally and on the state level, the prosecution may enter a nolle prosequi any time before jeopardy attaches, which occurs when the jury is empaneled or, in a nonjury trial, when the court has begun hearing evidence.  Although a nolle prosequi is similar to a motion to dismiss, the requirements for charges to be abandoned via a nolle prosequi vary greatly in each jurisdiction and can have serious implications on prosecutorial autonomy.  Although many courts and statutes use the terms nolle prosequi and motion for dismissal interchangeably, the difference is that prosecutors discretion varies across jurisdictions when filing a nolle prosequi, but must always seek the court’s consent when filing a motion to dismiss.  \n",

During this period, the public prosecuted most offenses and accordingly many prosecutions were frivolous.  The attorney general in England used the nolle prosequi to dismiss prosecutions that they regarded as frivolous or in contravention of royal interests.  This power was entirely within the domain of the attorney general and thus no form of judicial review existed.  \n",

The American colonies established a system for processing official prosecutions that was extremely complex and required more prosecutors to handle the increased workload.  Due to the increased number of prosecutors, colonial governors, through their general law enforcement powers, had to direct these prosecutors and often did so by requiring them to enter a nolle prosequi on cases the governors thought did not merit prosecution.  Prosecutors also used the nolle prosequi to control criminal prosecutions they had begun if they later gathered information that indicated pursuing the prosecution was no longer just or proper.  \n",

The next category of states have given judges the ability to curtail the prosecutor’s nolle prosequi power, albeit with varying conditions required.

These states vary as to whether they require a prosecutor to state their reasons on the record for the nolle prosequi.  Even though prosecutors are given complete discretion in these states, judicial review is still allowed and expected in certain specific situations that vary in each state but often include corruption, capricious or scandalous behavior, and infringement on defendants rights.  For example, in State v. Reimonenq, court acknowledged that the prosecutor had sole discretion to make decisions regarding prosecution, but stated that the prosecutorial decision to nolle prosequi the case and refile simply to organize their case upset the balance between the prosecutor’s discretion and the accused rights to such a degree that it violated the defendants right to due process and fundamental fairness.  \n",

Local prosecutors elected status makes them accountable to the public for their decisions, including their decisions to nolle prosequi.

Additionally, judges should be able to review the reasons for a nolle prosequi to ensure that the prosecutor hasn’t acted corruptly and to protect the defendant’s constitutional rights.  In sum, although every state is free to balance the separations of powers as they see fit, local prosecutors should be given discretion to nolle prosequi within constitutional limits while being statutorily required to explain their reasoning on the record.

Pol. & Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 343, 343 (2010) (connecting relationship between high incarceration and prosecutorial discretion).  In 2019, the total prison population in the United States was 1,430,800, which is often described by experts as a mass incarceration crisis.  See U.S. Dep’t of Just., Prisoners in 2019, 1 (2020), https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p19.pdf, [https://perma.cc/NB66-5DLG] (comparing prison population trends over several years); Traum, supra note 2, at 425 (defining mass incarceration and arguing harmful and destabilizing effects on communities); Mirko Bagaric et al., Mitigating America’s Mass Incarceration Crisis Without Compromising Community Protection:  Expanding the Role of Rehabilitation in Sentencing, 22 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 3, 59 (2018) (concluding the United States experiencing unprecedented mass incarceration crisis).  In the past ten years, prosecutors have examined the operation of the criminal justice and pushed for alternatives to incarceration.  See Yaroshefsky, supra at 343-45 (noting state initiatives with reform focus).  These alternatives include community service, electronic monitoring, probation, restitution, or treatment.  See generally James Austin, A Guidelines Proposal:  How Many Americans are Unnecessarily Incarcerated?, 29 Fed. Sent. R. 140 (2017) (considering proposed alternatives to incarceration and arguing their superior effectiveness).  Many experts assert that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi, should be used to end the mass incarceration crisis in the United States.  See Jeffrey Bellin, Reassessing Prosecutorial Power Through the Lens of Mass Incarceration, 116 Mich. L. Rev. 835, 836 (2018) (articulating legal expert’s opinion that prosecutors can alleviate damage caused by mass incarceration); Angela J. Davis, The Prosecutor’s Ethical Duty to End Mass Incarceration, 44 Hofstra L. Rev. 1063, 1085 (2016) (concluding prosecutors have ethical duty to end mass incarceration).  Other experts feel that prosecutorial discretion, including the power to nolle prosequi has played a significant role in causing the mass incarceration crisis.
