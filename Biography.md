# Python-Cite-Checker
Python Cite Checker made for Suffolk Law Review in connection with the Suffolk University Law School class Coding the Law.  Anaconda is needed to run this program, which can be downloaded at https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads

A private youtube video catalouging the development is available for viewing at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odfp6NNCU58.  Please contact mpatalano@suffolk.edu for access.


The below is to address the main grading criteria for this project.

# Framing
My client was Suffolk Law Review.  From the beginning, my goal was to improve the citechecking process.  Although we could have attempted to help make the process faster, it was clear that the client was more concerned with making a product that could prevent cite checker error.  This allowed me to focus future issues on resolving this issue.
# Research
I began by looking at the current solutions available to the client.  It was clear that the status quo was not sufficent because mistakes were being made, and a "store bought" cite checker could not be narrowly tailored to Suffolk Law Review's grammatical rules.  I soon settled on making a program that would be able to use regular expressions to find errors, which lead me to either Word Macros or a Python Program.  I ultimately settled on a Python Program because Word does not have a sufficently advanced regular expression capability.
# Ideation & Prototyping
The first ideatopm was with a Word Macro because I thought this would be more user friendly.  The regular expressions offered by Word were not robust enough and in order to make a product that did robust cite checking, I ultimately settled on making a python program.  Through trial and error (see python notebook) I was able to add one rule at a time to make a usable program.
# User Testing
Although I will continue to test, at the time of this submission there have been three user testing phases.  The first phase, conducted while the product was in development, consisted of user observation.  Users observed as I used the program.  Informal feedback was requested and collected and devolpment was tailored based on feedback.  The second phase of user testing was guided user testing.  After MVP was achieved, Users were instructed on how to use the app and were observed using it.  My observations and informal feedback lead to alterations in design.  The final and current stage of user testing is non guided user testing.  Users are using the app without guidance and responding to a google form.  User responses at the time of this entry are on the spreadsheet titled Python Cite Checker (Responses).  User testing will likely continue into the spring
